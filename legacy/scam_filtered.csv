7879071,"Recently I was a victim of a work from home job opportunity which turned out to be a fraud/scam that targeted and stole all my money from linked sources to my venmo account. I contacted venmo and went through the difficult process of contacting support to file a report and dispute. Up to that point I had not had anh issues or filed any disputes, and i have been a long time customer of venmo. After over a week of back and forth with customer support and sending proof and supporting documents to prove my claim, I eventually get transferred to a sketchy "" account specialist '' email with no direct phone number. The "" specialist '' emails me saying that my account is suspended and something about violating venmo terms. Every other disputed transaction was approved and the others, especially the larger transactions I was scammed from were denied. It literally looks obvious that the specialist picked and chose which transactions to approve and denied the important ones. I respond to the email voicing my concerns about the investigation process and resend all my proof, police reports, screenshots, etc. Only days later to find out that my account was permanently closed and my funds locked in venmo. I am unable to contact or reach the "" account specialist '' or anyone directly because they are only reachable by email. Also, they respond in an untimely manner of 7-10 business days which is not acceptable. I need help please. Venmo is neglecting to and it seems purposely avoiding their obligation to the customers."

Arrived at condo in XX/XX/XXXX to find no one there and no one to contect, scammers were gone. Filed complaint with XXXX XXXX Police and FBI. 
XXXX Wells Fargo Scam Department in XX/XX/XXXX, filed complaint. We were told at that time the XXXX account to which we made deposit in was closed in XX/XX/XXXX for fraudulent activity. Asked why we were not notified to which that answered they couldn't tell us for privacy regulations. I said how can it be a privacy violation when we knew the account number and name, again privacy regulation? Asked why the police were not notified to which they said they don't usually do this. I said once the police are involved legal process takes over so privacy regulation does not apply. He didn't know for sure. 
I have tried to resolve this matter several times with escalation to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX with no results, XXXX claims no responsibility in this scam I have said over and over if we had known in XXXX it could have lead to prosecution of scammers and stopped the second payment.

6774482,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a check from a job that I had applied for. I applied for a job with a healthcare company and the check came from a healthcare provider so I assumed it was a legitimate job. I went through the interview process and was told I had been hired but I needed to go through training. I was told that I needed to purchase the equipment to be able to do the job and since the company was out of the country I would need to buy the equipment myself. When I received the check my manager wanted me to deposit the check into my account but wait until it cleared before spending any of the funds. I thought that once the check cleared it was fine because what bank would clear a bad check? I waited until it cleared and notified the hiring manager. She proceeded to tell me to send the money via XXXX to 2 different accounts. I was told that I was sending money to Vendors who had the equipment and they were going to come install it at my house. I was told to send {$2000.00} to one person and {$1500.00} to another but the transfers were broken up into separate amounts. She also wanted me to send money via XXXX XXXX but XXXX XXXX refunded it back to me. Her last request was for a {$500.00} gift card. She asked me to take a picture of the card and send it to her. She wanted me to buy the gift card so that I could use it to get a landline installed at my house. I was told to go to XXXX XXXX and purchase a printer and headset for the job as well. 
The hiring manager sent me a {$4500.00} check asked for nearly all the funds back and once the check bounced I was left with an account that was {$4500.00} in the negative. Bank of America cleared the check but they are refusing to take responsibility for it. I also quoted Federal Regulation E, from the EFT Act that the Bank must reimburse you even if you sent the money yourself and someone induced you to send them money. When I called the Bank, I was told that this is a common scam but they are unwilling to do anything about it. 
The bank cleared the check so I thought this was a legitimate job opportunity. There was no protection for me from the bank, they should have stopped the transactions immediately."

- H obtains a receipt from the ATM for the deposit stating that the deposit will be reviewed. No money or information on the deposit is visible on my account in the next hour. H calls Wells Fargo customer service immediately to file a claim and is told that the checks are under review and resolution XXXX take XXXX business days.

14388860,"I was misled by an acquaintance into sending {$300.00} through XXXX ( from my Chase checking account ) based on a false promise involving my Chase credit card. 

While visiting XXXX, Michigan, this person said their company allows them to use gift cards to pay off other peoples bills at a 50 % discount. They offered to make a {$600.00} payment toward my Chase credit card. After I confirmed the payment had posted to my account, I sent them {$300.00} via XXXX to the email address they gave me assuming it was a legitimate transaction. 

Later, the {$600.00} credit card payment was reversed, and I realized the gift card or method they used was likely fraudulent or stolen. I now understand that I was manipulated. The XXXX payment I made went to someone I dont know, and the person who coordinated this with me has now disconnected their number and it is no longer in service ( XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX ), so I can no longer reach them.

I reported this to Chase, but they could not help my request to recover the XXXX payment saying it was authorized but they said they can file a claim. They did not tell me how the claim would help me. I contacted XXXX and Chase credit card customer service, but they could not help. While I did send the payment myself, I was misled under false pretenses, and the payment was based on a transaction that was later found to be fraudulent. 

I am requesting a full review of the {$300.00} XXXX transfer and the associated {$600.00} credit card reversal, along with any assistance available to recover my money. I'm willing to share more information and proof."

I reached out to "" him '' and told him that my sister was interested in purchasing the car. So he said "" send me her information '' and I'll reach out to her- so I sent him her facebook information. They were in communication and then apparently he sent her a # to zelle the {$500.00} deposit to- it kicked back and said : Sorry for the inconvenience, but XXXX is under maintenance - you'll receive your refund within XXXX hours back into your account - then her told her, maybe it's the amount, so try to send {$100.00} - so she did and she got the same response. I told her I would try, so I reached out to him vis XXXX XXXX, and told him I would try to get him the deposit for her- so he gave me a # to send it to, which he said was his uncle 's sister ( XXXX was supposedly in hospice ) - so I zelled the {$500.00} to that # - got the same response back that my sister did, stating it was because of a maintenance issue and the money would be refunded within XXXX hours. I explained that to him and he told me to try XXXX XXXX, so I did and it declined the money ; then said try to send it as a gift card of the apple application, and it declined it again. So he wanted me to try to XXXX XXXX again, then it finally went through the next 2 days along with the zelle payment that supposedly wasn't going through. That person sent me several phone # 's claiming it was a family member of his and maybe that they were having an issue on their end - then next day he kept asking for the money that was "" never received '' - so that prompted me that this has to be someone who hacked my friends XXXX ( because everything looked legit that this was actually my friend when I went on his page ). I Googled all of the # 's that we were given, and not XXXX of them were anyone I knew and were people out of XXXX XXXX- I reported it to my Bank XXXX Bank of America ) and they told me that more than likely I wasn't getting any of my money back, which I didn't and even reached out to XXXX XXXX bank, and they stated the same since I willing sent the money to the people. So my sister is out {$600.00} and I'm out {$1000.00} - apparently my friends XXXX had been hacked for months, but XXXX did nothing to remove it. I have all the screenshots of the # 's and conversations- just would like to get my money back.

11879581,"On XX/XX/year>, I faced the consequences of losing {$3500.00} and deducting {$150.00} along with compromising my identity because of a job scam. I received a text from an unknown XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) asking if I would like to be eligible for a position as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for XXXX XXXX She referred me to XXXX XXXX XXXX a XXXX  chat. I conversed with HR from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and proceeded to do an in-chat interview. I was told that I was hired and would start working on XX/XX/year>. I was asked to send a Photo ID by XXXX and HR provided a start-up check that covers software/office equipment suppliers. He asked me go to the bank to make a wire transfer and provided another vendor 's wire transfer info. I found that check funds from XXXX were insufficient that it took money out of my checking account. I stated to XXXX over XXXX chat that he would call the accounting dept and they would reinstate the check amount of XXXX dollars. He asked me to provide my account numbers and routing numbers. But that was my last interaction with him before receiving no response on his end. I went to the bank for help and a refund request but they won't help me out."
8238282,"Despite amble evidence that the transaction was indeed fraudulent, fifth third bank deemed the transaction valid which I lost {$2000.00} from. Fifth third bank knew the check deposited was fraudulent but refused to dispute the transaction of {$1500.00} and transaction of {$500.00} for transfer to XXXX XXXX. The transaction occurred on XX/XX/XXXX of 2023. The whole transaction happened as a result of the scammer tricking me into sending money with that check that fifth bank recognized as fraudulent. Therefore, the transactions for transfer to XXXX XXXX  are invalid and should be illegal to deny a dispute for. I tried calling the disputes department multiple times and even warned them, I will take you to court for deciding the invalid transaction is valid."
14438348,I understand that my account was permanently deactivated due to suspicious activity in XXXX. Im writing to clarify that I was a victim of a job scam and had no intention of violating XXXX terms. I would deeply appreciate the opportunity to provide documentation and context around what happened.
11293997,"XXXX. Refunds Issued as Gift Cards Instead of Cash I made a request in XXXX not to receive refunds via gift cards, yet Macy 's has continued to issue them despite your preferences. This issue has been ongoing for several years since XXXX and still going all these years. 
Despite multiple interactions with customer service and confirmations that gift cards were issued, you never received them. 
XXXX. Expired Gift Cards and No Reimbursement According to the most recent information provided by a Macys representative, there are a {$40.00} gift cards issued in your name, but they have expired because they were not used within the time frame. Macys is now refusing to refund you in any other manner. 
Ive been told that these gift cards are no longer valid, but no other refund option or compensation has been offered. 
3. Lack of Clear Communication and Documentation Despite being a loyal customer and consistently paying my bills on time, Im experiencing poor customer service and no one at Macys seems to know whats going on with your refunds. 
I spoke to a supervisor in the gift card department who claimed to have access to your orders but could not provide any information on the returns associated with those gift cards.

4. Delayed Refunds and Accrued Interest Another issue Ive faced is delays in receiving refunds for returns. I noticed that refunds often take several weeks, causing you to incur interest charges on your Macy 's credit card for money I should have already been reimbursed.

This delay in issuing refunds seems to be a recurring problem.

5. Discrepancies in Order Dates Ive noticed discrepancies in my account, specifically with order dates. For example, you I told that an order was placed on XX/XX/XXXX, but when I checked, the order was actually submitted on XX/XX/XXXX. This could indicate issues with Macy 's internal records or the handling of your account. 
6. Legal Rights Im aware that, under the law, customers are entitled to a refund within 10 days after returning a product, provided the return has been confirmed as received by the company. It seems that Macy 's is not adhering to this timeline in your case, and the delay has caused significant inconvenience and financial harm. 
7. Unfair Treatment I believe that, as a long-time customer who has always paid her bills on time, you should not be treated this way. Im asking for my money back, as well as any interest that may have been accrued due to Macys failure to process my refund in a timely manner."
7255848,"On XX/XX/23, I used my card ending in XXXX to purchase several items on XXXX due to their XXXX XXXX event. The transactions went through without any problems. However, the following day on XX/XX/23, I noticed I could no longer view my entire card number online, which is a feature US Bank offers ( See Picture XXXX ). Consequently, I called in only to have several representatives tell me all my accounts were closed. I soon called the XXXX number to get an idea why all my accounts were closed and the representative told me it was because of gift card purchases on my card ending in XXXX ( See Picture XXXX ). However, the transactions are still pending and will later be reversed because the transactions have been refunded. So all in all, it seems US Bank waited for me to complete the {$2000.00} minimum spend requirement ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) to get the signup bonus valued at {$500.00} on the card ending in XXXX and then closed all my accounts a day later without notice."

I told her she was scamming me and didnt by the cards. Upon arriving home she called again and said I cold get just 2 cards. I told her no and that I was going to contact the FBI. When I tried contacting the number again it was ( out of service ).

Unfortunately, I fell victim to a scam, and the scammer not only failed to deliver the promised goods but also blocked me after receiving payment. I promptly reported the incident to Venmo, providing detailed proof and screenshots to substantiate my claim. 

Previous Claim : It is important to note that I have successfully filed a similar claim in the past with Venmo for a lesser amount, and it was approved. The key difference this time is that I used my Venmo balance for the payment, leaving me unable to dispute the transaction with my bank. 

Proof Submitted : I have attached all necessary documentation, including screenshots of the XXXX XXXX conversation, evidence of the promised goods, confirmation of the Venmo payment, and subsequent blocking by the scammer. These documents clearly illustrate the fraudulent nature of the transaction. 

Venmo 's Response : Despite presenting compelling evidence and highlighting the similarities to a previously approved claim, Venmo has denied my request for reimbursement. The denial is perplexing and leaves me without recourse for recovering the funds that were fraudulently taken from me."

11498561,"Dear XXXX and XXXX, I requested a refund for overpaid taxes through Form 1040 while working in the US on a XXXXXXXX XXXX in XXXX, and I received a check for {$1800.00} from the XXXX Treasury around XX/XX/XXXX. 
I deposited this check into my Chase account via mobile checking on XX/XX/XXXX. 

However, the money was deposited, then went into a pending status, and eventually disappeared, leaving me unable to access my account. 
I contacted Chase to ask why my account was suddenly blocked, and they initially claimed that my check seemed fake, which led to my account being locked. 
They then changed their story, saying that my account was not allowed to do mobile checking, but I attempted it anyway, which caused the lock. 

Chase informed me that my account would soon be closed, and that the {$98.00} I had deposited before the checking would be sent to my home address as a check. However, the mail I received from Chase only indicated that my account had been processed to {$0.00} and closed, and there was no check included.

Chase told me that the check I deposited via mobile checking could not be used at Chase, and if I wanted to check it, they needed to verify the authenticity of the check from the US Treasury and inform Chase. Since I informed Chase that I had returned to XXXX, I interpreted this as Chase having no intention of providing me with the funds.

Additionally, since Chase told me that my check was unheld, I assumed that the check deposit had not been processed, so I went to XXXXXXXX XXXX in XXXX to cash it. 

However, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received an urgent call from XXXX XXXX XXXXnforming me that they had received a notification from Chase stating that the check had already been cashed on XX/XX/XXXX. 

As a result, I had to return all the funds I received from XXXXXXXX XXXX Due to the issues I experienced with Chase, I was unable to recover the tax refund I received from the US Treasury, and I was misunderstood as having used a bad check at the XXXX bank. 

I am attaching three files as evidence regarding this matter : 1. The letter from the IRS stating that they would refund my taxes.

2. The document from Chase stating that my check had already been cashed on XX/XX/XXXX, sent to XXXXXXXX XXXX 
XXXX. My bank statement sent by Chase instead of the check."

In addition to this, I had points on that card that could have been redeemed for cash and or gift cards that they claim I can not be reimbursed for. 

I asked them about stopping the closing of the account, reimbursing me for the rewards lost, and notified them how this would negatively impact me.

That same afternoon ( XX/XX/year> ), I set up an in-person meeting with a Bank Clerk XXXX She said claims can not be made in a branch so she called the Chase Claims Department.

Chase said there was nothing they could do to stop the checks nor return my wire transfers. The fake checks had not been endorsed and they were deposited immediately. I spoke to the bank clerk about why some checks are deposited immediately and others are held, and she said Chase doesn't have a system for how they handle good/bad checks. My husband, who also banks with Chase, oftentimes waits 7-10 days for employer checks to deposit.

When I returned with my husband after finding out about the missing funds, the branch representative shared many tales of similar situations of customers of their branch that had been defrauded- so they are aware that this is a major problem, but took zero action to prevent it in our case, and likely continue to allow this to happen."

I received an email with check images that I incorrectly thought I could deposit. The check was fake, and it came from a bogus company name and address also held at Wells Fargo. Prior to deposit I checked to see if this was a valid routing and account number ; the system we use for check deposit verified the case. I honestly thought it would clear. 

This party used text message numbers and emails to communicate with me at the end of each day to send more money ; the delay each day was adding to some fees/taxes that prevented anything from being sent.

As my credit card of your company, TJX Rewards Card offered by Synchrony Bank I do not care the mentioning about the rewards certificates which I could not use at all. It just frustrating and annoying to see the receipts which I can not recognize at all. Some of them which indicated as I bought, I could not figure out what it was from the beginning. I do not know what XXXX  XXXX XXXX was ( XX/XX/XXXX24 ). I remember I bought a lot of clearance frames which was {$1.00} each wishing I would use for my XXXX. The sale of frame ( XXXX XXXX XXXX {$8.00} ) might be that one. However, I believe I have bought more than 8. I do not know what XXXX  XXXX  XXXX ( {$6.00} ) is. There is another XXXX  XXXX ( XXXX {$15.00} ), which I do not know since I am not an employee of XXXX. The Jewelry/watch XXXX and XXXX must be the clearance silver bracelet or something and one   made in XXXX earrings XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX24, and I do not know what XXXX XXXX ( XXXX {$9.00} ) is on XX/XX/XXXX24. I remember I bought several throws which were under {$30.00}, even though they were more than {$100.00} ; even though the designs were not my favor. But they were 100 % cotton and made in USA. Another one was an XXXX rabbit one for children. It was originally {$30.00}, and with a reward certificate {$10.00}. I loved to find out the secret treasures in XXXX, XXXX. XXXX, XXXX. Now, it is XXXX and boring, since there is no fun to get something cheaper with rewards. Since the card was closed, I do not care what your company depicts how the certificates have been used. Just XXXX employee ( s ) made some fake receipts. You do not have to explain about how I can get reward anymore since I do not have your company card. The explanation is disgusting. Since the website account, which must have been mine, disappeared ; therefore, it is useless to mention I can use the certificate ( XXXX ) in either paper or paperless. As far as I remember, TJX Rewards or XXXX company gave me {$10.00} gift card at the beginning. Since XXXX related so many companies, I lost the trace. Then, I complained everywhere. And at least {$20.00} reward certificate ending in XXXX was replacement certificates of some of unused {$10.00} certificates. I have with them, but I do not want to check which ones were originals. 
I am not sure whether somebody hacked or not as you stated. What I can say is the account is closed, and I do not have the card ending XXXX. And I receive some letters and emails related with a card ending XXXX. Since I have never asked your company to issue the replacement card, I do not owe any card ending XXXX. From the beginning, I need to request why a card ending XXXX exists. And I have one concern whether your company can say I will not receive any more letters for card ending XXXX, especially a bill. I still go to this shop XXXX on XXXX. XXXX, XXXX, but not so often. I only buy clearance foods and the shop is worthy for that. 
I receive the letters from XXXX and XXXX, and emails from XXXX asking me my identification documents, even though I never requested any service from them. I sent identification information for them for security freeze. Maybe, because your company provided my address to these agencies without my consent, they are sending the letters. As far as I understand what these credit report companies state only under my request, they can issue the documents. If you provide my address and personal information, I think you leak my identity. As a victim of identity theft, I consider it is serious. Therefore, I report it to the federal agencies.

Dear : XXXX We apologise for the late response as we were upgrading our server which has now been sorted out. We have successfully verified and confirmed that you have refunded the buyer and the funds have been approved to be credited into your account immediately. 

But on the verge of crediting the total pending payment of {$3500.00} USD as we notified you earlier which was paid by the buyer XXXX XXXX. We looked through our Data-Base and found a total pending payment of {$3500.00} USD. There has been another new payment of {$1000.00} USD from the same buyer XXXX XXXX making a double payment from the same buyer. 

We are unable to separate the payments as they have been added to our database and all the funds are pending in your account, as such, we can't proceed to credit your account with your initial pending payment of {$2500.00} USD. 

We are aware of the fact that the new payment of {$1000.00} USD was a mistake on the part of the buyer 's Accountant as he over credited your account. We have then looked into ways of resolving the issue so we can then credit your account with the payment. But as it is now, it has already been recorded in our Data-base and there is no way we can separate these funds. Funds are not returnable to the buyer. In this case, you own the total money. 

We have also tabled the transaction before the Board Of Directors and they have advised that the payment ( s ) still remain "" ON-HOLD/Pending here while you make the refund of the new payment of {$100.00} USD through XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Gift card options after which we shall then credit your account with total payments of {$3500.00} USD Note the buyer 's account has now been suspended. 

So you are allowed to send the refund through the XXXX, XXXX, XXXX pay or Gift card option so that we can credit your account with the total pending of {$3500.00} USD. 

NOTE : Funds deducted from the buyer 's account is not returnable to the buyer 's account. So you are in total control of the funds once we credit it. 

We await your swift response which should include the details of the refund.

The claims team at XXXX recorded my complaint and provided a case number. They began a wire recall request, which was denied because I had willingly sent the money. I received a letter from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to that effect. When I called XXXX back, I was told Wells Fargo responded to them, basically saying unless the funds recipient contacted them and gave permission to return the funds to me, the bank would not.

11210605,"My son XXXX XXXX XXXX ) has a Venmo XXXX debit card that I approved him to get. He has used this card for some time to manage his expenses without issue, and part of the feature of this card is that I get notified every time he makes a purchase, sends or receives money. As the parent, I help manage his account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received 2 purchase notifications approximately one hour apart : one for a purchase at XXXX at XXXX and another one at XXXX at XXXX ( central time ). My son was asleep. 

He immediately reached out to Venmo to ask how to deal with these suspect charges since he did not make them. They indicated they could do nothing until the charges 'settled ' which was not for a couple of days. He then submitted the dispute and explained he did not make the purchase at XXXX. Note, the one for XXXX never cleared, so they obviously stopped it. They temporarily refunded the {$97.00} to his account for the disputed XXXX purchase. 

We explained the situation thoroughly and asked for the charges to be refunded. After weeks of waiting, they finally responded with the fact that the merchant "" said these charges were legit and used to buy XXXX XXXX gift cards ''. He did not buy these. and I think we're all aware that gift cards are the typical vehicle for fraud. Also the fact that barely one hour later someone again attempted to use his number pretty clearly demonstrates that these purchases were both fraudulent. 

Venmo then proceeded to take the funds of {$97.00} from his account. I once again reached out to them to dispute it yet again and provided the same proof. I also scoured my son 's email to confirm he did not lie about the XXXX purchase, he didn't. This isn't something he'd do anyway. 

He's being taking advantage of as a minor, and never have I encountered so much pushback when I've immediately flagged fraudulent charges on a debit or credit card with other banks. I've never had to 'prove ' they weren't mine. Venmo is treating this very poorly and now my XXXX year old is out almost {$100.00} that he had nothing to do with. He never misplaced his debit card, either, so it's not like the fraudsters had the physical use of it. 

Did they ask XXXX to confirm WHERE the purchase was made via IP address? If it was made online they would have that information. Was it out of XXXXXXXX XXXX? They didn't provide that to me, that's for certain. They brushed us off entirely with a response of "" XXXX said it was legit ''. 

I have attached the notifications I received when these fraudulent purchases were made. These same notifications were also provided to Venmo as part of the investigation."

Recovering from XXXX XXXXXXXX, I want to get back to the workforce by posting my resume on XXXX. 
As usually, I was approached by email with a job offer by XXXX XXXX XXXX, a presumed hiring Manager of the Company XXXX XXXX XXXX. He put me through a job interview and hired me as a Customer Service Representative in a meeting on XXXX XXXX platform. 

After I have accepted and signed the XXXX XXXX XXXX, the next day of our meeting, he offered to pay off all my credit cards balance as stated on the XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, as the way to let me use my cards to purchase for my work equipment. 

He gave me routing and bank account number and the bank name to use to pay off all my credit cards. I did and reported to him with all the payment confirmations numbers. After that he directed me to use my cards to purchase XXXX and XXXX to send to their software manager for software installation. As the available balances can not be enough for the equipment, he wanted me instead to purchase XXXX gift cards to allow him to make arrangement with the company software manager and vendor. I did purchase those gift cards with my XXXX XXXX XXXX card and Citi Card, and also {$2000.00} borrowed from my wife. All the conversations and details are on the pdf attached to the letter. 
In summary, all the clear details are on the pdf from the bank account to some scammers names. 

Now my concern is how you facilitate the system for him to roll back the money without any warning to me. Without any investigation. 
I am the one who call to paid off the card and for refueling for another purchase with this bank information. Before any cancellation you need to contact me first to know what about. If it was any criminal act, you got the right to pursuit me. 
This is not fair to help somebody to steal from me with your help. 
Kindly, I recommend Citi Bank to open a criminal investigation on this bank account, given to me to paid of my credit cards, and afterwards let me refuel the card to deepen my debit. You need to let the FBI be involved to get to the bottom of this. You can not easily put this financial burden on me. 

Secondly, I recommend you stop any collection action again me, and late fees, until we get the whole fact ; and restore my credit card to the balance it was, before you roll back the credits.

Issue Summary : On XX/XX/year>, a check in the amount of {$3400.00}, payable to me, was fraudulently deposited at Bank of America. However, I never received these funds. 

Upon investigating this matter, XXXX XXXX, the payor bank, confirmed in writing that Bank of America, as the depositary bank, was responsible under UCC 3-420 for ensuring the authenticity of endorsements before accepting the deposit. XXXX XXXX has denied liability, stating that they paid the check in full and that the burden of verification rests with Bank of America. 

Supporting Evidence : I am attaching XXXX XXXX official response, which explicitly states : Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ) generally places the burden on the XXXX XXXX  in the collection chain to ensure that the requisite endorsements are present and authentic. 
Since XXXX XXXX was the drawee/payor bank and not the bank of the 1st deposit, it is not liable in conversion under UCC 3-420 .

As the check was deposited at Bank of America, it is Bank of Americas responsibility to address this matter."

In late XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted to use the gift cards and was advised they were no longer valid and could not be used. The gift cards do NOT have any expiration date ( s ) on them. Per the FTC 's Credit CARD ( Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure ) Act, gift cards can not expire any less than XXXX  years. In California, gift cards can not/do not expire art all. 

During XXXX and XXXX, I attempted to address the issue with the merchant. In XXXX, I contacted AMEX to dispute the charge. My telephonic request to dispute the charges was declined because the charges were no longer available ( dispute process can only be initiated on charges 60 days old or less ). I insisted there must be recourse available for transactions that are billed in advance ( i.e., airline tickets, vacation packages, custom built furniture/merchandise, etc... ) and then are not delivered/not rendered/not as described at the anticipated future date. I was advised to submit my request in writing. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I wrote a 3 page letter providing all the details ( original dates of charges, issue experienced in late XX/XX/XXXX, my unsuccessful efforts to address with merchant, etc .. ). I received a canned form letter regurgitating the 60 day time limit to dispute a charge. 

In XXXX, I then escalated to the Chairmans Office. A XXXX XXXX stressed that the 60 day time limit to dispute transactions is regulated by the FTC. I advised XXXX XXXX that the Credit CARD Act is also imposed and regulated by the FTC and that the gift cards expiring is a violation of the Credit CARD Act and therefore AMEX should be ensuring compliance with the Credit CARD Act and enforcing it with their merchants. I again received a number of canned form letters reiterating the 60 day time frame to dispute charges. 

I continued to email the Chairmans Office XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX with no acknowledgement nor response. I then escalated/sent an email to XXXX XXXX XXXX , AMEX CEO on XX/XX/XXXX.

As usually, I was approached by email with a job offer by XXXX XXXX XXXX, a presumed hiring Manager of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He put me through a job interview and hired me as a Customer Service Representative in a meeting on XXXX XXXX platform. 

After I have accepted and signed the Offer of Employment, the next day of our meeting, he offered to pay off all my credit cards balance as stated on the Offer of Employment, as the way to let me use my cards to purchase for my work equipment. 

He gave me routing and bank account number and the bank name to use to pay off all my credit cards. I did and reported to him with all the payment confirmations numbers. After that he directed me to use my cards to purchase XXXX and XXXX to send to their software manager for software installation. As the available balances can not be enough for the equipment, he wanted me instead to purchase XXXX gift cards to allow him to make arrangement with the company software manager and vendor. I did purchase those gift cards with my XXXX XXXX XXXX card and XXXX XXXX, and also {$2000.00} borrowed from my wife. All the conversations and details are on the pdf attached to the letter. 
In summary, all the clear details are on the pdf from the bank account to some scammers names. 
Now my concern is how you facilitate the system for him to roll back the money without any warning to me. Without any investigation. 
I am the one who call to paid off the card with a bank account information. Before any cancellation you need to contact me first to know what about. If it was any criminal act, you got the right to pursuit me. This is not fair to help somebody to steal from me with your help. 

Kindly, I recommend Synchrony Bank to open a criminal investigation on this bank account, given to me to paid of my credit cards, and afterwards let me refuel the cards to deepen my debit. You need to let the FBI be involved to get to the bottom of this. You can not easily put this financial burden on me. 

Secondly, I recommend you stop any collection action again me, and late fees, until we get the whole fact ; and restore my credit card back to paid off, as it was, before you roll back the credit. 

Looking forward to hearing from you, P.S.-Offer of Employment, XXXX of all the conversations of the presumed hiring manager of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX."

I was told that these transactions were being approved and processed after hours without my knowledge or authorization. Despite this, XXXX XXXX XXXX stated they could not stop or block the fraudulent transactions, nor could they put a hold on my account. I was advised to contact Cash App, as they were responsible for processing these unauthorized checks.

When I contacted Cash App, I was met with dismissive and unhelpful responses. Their representatives refused to provide clear information regarding the type of charge that made me liable and transferred me multiple times, each interaction becoming more demeaning. Despite my insistence, no one could explain why Cash App approved fraudulent checks or why they refused to assist me in recovering my stolen funds. They also implied that I must have shared my credentials, which I did not.

Further investigation revealed that multiple fraudulent checks were processed just below {$450.00} each to avoid triggering fraud alerts. Cash App failed to detect or prevent this pattern of fraud, and XXXX XXXX XXXX  refused to intervene. As a result, I am now facing severe financial hardship, eviction, and homelessness, despite having been financially stable before this fraud occurred.

I have attached documentation, including : My initial communication with XXXX XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/year> Bank statements showing the fraudulent transactions The banks final response after its internal investigation Proof of financial hardship and eviction proceedings I am requesting a full investigation into Cash Apps handling of these unauthorized transactions and XXXX XXXX XXXX refusal to protect my account. Additionally, I am seeking a resolution that includes the reversal of fraudulent charges and an acknowledgment of both Cash Apps and the banks failure to prevent financial harm.

This situation has left me in a dire financial position, threatening my housing, livelihood, and well-being. I urge the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to take immediate action to hold these institutions accountable and prevent further harm to consumers like myself.

Please let me know if you require any additional documentation. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

9676298,"Dear Sir and madam, I am writing to report an incident involving a fraudulent charity activity that I encountered recently. Below are the details of the scam : On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from XXXX XXXX about participating in a charity initiative. The activity involved purchasing gift cards for a charity that claimed to support orphans and the homeless. The compensation was stated to be {$450.00} per week for working flexible1-3 hours daily. 
I agreed to participate and began on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( email : XXXX ) sent me a {$500.00} check via email, which I deposited into my XXXX account using mobile banking. The funds appeared to be immediately available, so I purchased a {$500.00} Apple gift card from a nearby XXXX and sent the card details to XXXX XXXX ( email : XXXX ). 
I repeated this process on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I became suspicious and asked for the charity 's address. They provided an address that matched an actual charity online, which reassured me at the time. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed that the check from XX/XX/XXXX, had bounced. I contacted XXXX XXXX, who then sent me another {$1000.00} check. I deposited it, and it again showed as immediately available. I bought another {$1000.00} worth of Apple gift cards and sent them to the scammers. 
Believing the activity to be legitimate, I continued on XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX, XXXX, purchasing a total of {$3000.00} in Apple gift cards. On XX/XX/XXXX, I discovered that all the checks had bounced, and I was unable to reach XXXX XXXX. 
Due to my lack of understanding of check payment risks, I initially believed the funds were available when my mobile banking app showed the deposits as cleared. However, the checks were fraudulent, and my bank could not retrieve the funds from the originating account. 
I am requesting your assistance in investigating this matter and taking appropriate action against the individuals involved in this scam. 
Thank you for your attention to this matter. 
Sincerely,"
6889482,"My wife, XXXX XXXX, received a job offer from a company named XXXX XXXX in early XX/XX/XXXX. We researched this company and it appeared legitimate so she confirmed employment through XXXX XXXX XXXX as instructed. She was in contact with a XXXX XXXX multiple times over several days via the XXXX XXXX and direct conversations over the phone. He overnighted a check # XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX IL from a company called XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, MN for {$4800.00}. She direct deposited it to our Bank of America ( BOA ) checking account on XX/XX/XXXX and she was to XXXX 3 transacions of {$1000.00}, {$2500.00}, and {$1000.00} to 3 different emails for vendors to purchase computer hardware and software. Doing what we believed was due diligence, we contacted BOA afterwards and was told that the check was fine and not fraudulent. They later informed us that the check had cleared so we did the 3 XXXX transactions through the Bank of America site. XXXX immediately received a text from Bank of America that the check was fraudulent and to call them. 
XXXX at BOA answered from the fraud department and suspected a fraud due to "" tokens '', etc. and flagged all XXXX transactions to be frozen and not to be completed. She assured us that no funds would be transferred from our account. She also advised calling human resources at XXXX XXXX. 
XXXX was told by XXXX XXXX that there is no record of her getting employment and that 6 other people that week had been similarly defrauded. 
The next day we called BOA to confirm that XXXX 's assurance was correct. He initially said that the {$1000.00} was going out but then said that he was looking at the wrong page and that there was an updated second page stating that it was not going out and apologized for upsetting XXXX and assured us that nothing was going out. 
The next day we noticed that one of the three XXXX transactions had been completed to a XXXX XXXX for {$1000.00}. Then the original {$4800.00} was removed from our account by BOA leaving us down the {$1000.00} that was XXXX  resulting in multiple overdrafts from our checking account that we use for daily life. 
We contacted the F.B.I. who recommended completing an I.C.3 complaint referral form. 
We spoke to someone at BOA who said that because the bank deemed the check fraudulent that we had a very strong case and should file a BOA claim. Which we did. 
Approximately 7-10 days later we received a denial letter on our BOA claim. "" The transfer posted to the requested account according to intructions provided. We were unsuccessful at recovering the funds on your behalf ... '' This is when the frustrating interactions of conflicting information and illogical responses with BOA began. 
We called the "" we're here to help '' BOA number and was told initially that these decisions are never overturned but since we were told misinformation from BOA that it will be resent to the auditor and we will be contacted in 48 hours. Also that we should submit the IC3 complaint which we now did on XX/XX/XXXX. 
A week went by without any contact from BOA as promised so we called back. 
We were told contradictory information from the original BOA employee. 
Over multiple calls to BOA employees, supervisors, fraud departments, XXXX fraud, etc. over multiple weeks we were told everything from : the funds were frozen but one slipped through ; unapproved claims are never overturned ; XXXX transactions are instantaneous and can not be reversed ; no explanation why then 2 of the 3 were frozen and held ; no explanation why a fraud text to call back is sent if instantaneous and can not be reversed ; that we approved the XXXX transactions ; that if we read carefully it states that BOA is not responsible for XXXX even though it is promoted on their site ; we acknowledge everything you claim in terms of fraud and freezing but can not do anything. XXXX argued that there is a difference between fraud and scam and this is scam not fraud despite BOA and FBI referring to it as employment fraud. 
On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX received a missed call voicemail from a XXXX XXXX, BOA executive escalation group, XXXX XXXX. After a few episodes of phone tag between XXXX and this XXXX, XXXX called BOA and was told there is no record of her as a BOA employee. 
We have been with Bank of America since it was XXXXXXXX XXXX in XXXX."

That seemed wrong, but I was mourning the recent loss of our former, beloved cat and was not thinking straight ; I was also already {$850.00} into the transaction. I was told most of the payment would be refunded as part of a rental service, so I attempted to complete the transaction. It was blocked by Cash App, so I tried a few other methods, all of which were blocked, which lead the party requiring additional payment to request it in terms of XXXX or XXXX gift cards sent via XXXX XXXX. That was a resounding red flag, and I immediately contacted my bank and Cash App to recover my money. Despite many attempts to recover my money, Cash App has persistently refused to refund it claiming they are a peer-to-peer cash transfer service and not a payment service, and thus can not be held accountable for fraud on their platform. Such policies have allowed these scams to run rampant on their platform, wreaking havoc on families such as my own. {$850.00} is a significant amount of money to me. They said all I could do was request a refund from the seller, which a scammer would clearly ignore, but to play their game I requested one and was unsurprisingly rejected. Cash App has refused all further attempts to recover my money."

13513236,"Crypto.com has many support problems with their phone app not connecting to support and their XXXXcrypto.com weblink not working when used on XXXX phones ( 72 % of phones out there. ). People turn to social media to find support and apparently scammers are there as well. 

After reporting a problem one is having on Crypto.com, the social media number one calls says they have reported my account for closure. Then a scammer contacts you representing themselves as Crypto.com support saying that they are verifying my account closure and prevent the closure and take your issue from there forward. This separate number was a XXXX person named XXXX who did all this. 

As they get into your account, they ask you to delete it for 24 hours and then all will be better. When you reinstall, the damage has been done. The scammer could not use a withdrawal account he created due to my security but crypto.com promotes a credit card ( which I never had ). The scammer applies for a credit card while in your account and while the card application is pending, not even complete, they are able to move funds out, make purchases, buy gift cards, pay their cell phone bills, etc. In dealing with crypto.com after this happened, they really don't treat this like any normal credit card would. I need to report this to the FTC as well. Any bank that offers a credit card has a strong requirement to chase fraud, not let charges go onto a newly 'pending ' card. 

BUYER BEWARE - do not get Crypto.com 's credit card as it proves to be a quick backdoor into your financial account, even if you don't apply for the card. It will drain your finances and their support desk seems ill equipped to deal with this credit card scamming issue."

As usually, I was approached by email with a job offer by XXXX XXXX XXXX, a presumed hiring Manager of the Company XXXX XXXX XXXX. He put me through a job interview and hired me as a Customer Service Representative in a meeting on XXXX XXXX platform. 

After I have accepted and signed the XXXX XXXX XXXX, the next day of our meeting, he offered to pay off all my credit cards balance as stated on the XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, as the way to let me use my cards to purchase for my work equipment. 

He gave me routing and bank account number and the bank name to use to pay off all my credit cards. I did and reported to him with all the payment confirmations numbers. After that he directed me to use my cards to purchase XXXX and XXXX to send to their software manager for software installation. As the available balances can not be enough for the equipment, he wanted me instead to purchase XXXX gift cards to allow him to make arrangement with the company software manager and vendor. I did purchase those gift cards with my XXXX XXXX XXXX card and XXXX XXXX, and also {$2000.00} borrowed from my wife. All the conversations and details are on the pdf attached to the letter. 
In summary, all the clear details are on the pdf from the bank account to some scammers names. 

Now my concern is how you facilitate the system for him to roll back the money without any warning to me. Without any investigation. 
I am the one who call to paid off the card with a bank account information. Before any cancellation you need to contact me first to know what about. If it was any criminal act, you got the right to pursuit me. This is not fair to help somebody to steal from me with your help. 

Kindly, I recommend Discover Card to open a criminal investigation on this bank account, given to me to paid of my credit cards, and afterwards let me refuel the cards to deepen my debit. You need to let the FBI be involved to get to the bottom of this. You can not easily put this financial burden on me. 

Secondly, I recommend you stop any collection action again me, and late fees, until we get the whole fact ; and restore my credit card back to paid off, as it was, before you roll back the credit.

Note : This report includes Zelle transactions made from my XXXX XXXX and XXXX bank accounts at the direction of the same bad actors money mule ecosystem team performing the scam to defraud me! 

First, my family and I have been threatened of being harmed by your customers and their ecosystem of team members. You let criminals into your banks and they know our names, address and more about us due to using a story of they are shipping things to XXXX / victims and need our address and phone. 

While reading our attached reports understand the shipping company is not real, is not licensed as they say and has created fake documents to appear real including using money mules that become scam bankers clients and once they are into your banks they have will to rob/ steal by inducing innocent bank clients o XXXX money to the thieves you let into your banks as customers. I contacted the agencies the shipper says created the documents for receipts and emails were contacted and they all reported they have no such shipper, documents or involvement. These criminals are that good at creating fake websites that look real and even give a way to track the shipment and at creating fake names and ID 's to open up bank accounts at your banks. 

With that we will not stop until we get justice and made whole, with the help of the CFPB and other agencies like major media to the Bureau of Financial Institutions. You should consider this when making your decision to do the right thing! 

The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations report dated XX/XX/XXXX, by Chairman XXXX XXXX, United States Senate defines scam as : Scams include instances when a consumer is tricked or persuaded into authorizing a payment for a good or service that is never provided ( XXXX this XXXX page investigation report ). 

I report that all services I paid for have never and will never be received and that I was scammed, tricked into induced fraud by your bank customers due to the banks failures to XXXX. Basically the banks are letting their customers rob innocent customers. The bank let them in! The herein and attached documents will support and expose these statements. 

I have experienced exactly what you ( the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau - CFPB ) report of in the XX/XX/XXXX lawsuit against XXXX XXXX Zelle XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( court case # XXXX, copy attached ). This case shows banks let these criminals into their banks not us. We have been threatened of being harmed by your customers! 

Please read this and the attached documents in their entirety to learn the full details and extent of this crime/s ( induced fraud, authorized fraud, scams, identity theft, fake shipper website, fake companies, using money mules ). 

I have learned ( after the fact ) that at least XXXX - XXXX banks have known about this problem for years ( read the lawsuit identified above and the other reports cited herein ) and that the banks are knowingly opening up accounts and then blaming the victims ( the banks innocent customers ) for working with thieves, the customer/s the bank/s opened up the account for. 

Because of the "" Know Your Client '' laws the banks make the victims ( me included ) think and feel it is safe and secure to use the bank services ( Zelle XXXX bank wires ) to other banks/ customers only to now learn after the fact that the banks knew of these criminals for years and never warned the customers. The criminals were allowed to opened up bank accounts with fake ID 's, documents, credentials, aliases, fake nonexistent businesses names ( using names very similar to real business ), which if we can find this out the banks certainly should have caught this and denied the account. The banks failed to protect its customers, failed to do basic verification on the criminals and the fake credential they use, causing me financial and emotional harm to say the least. 

I filed fraud claims for each of these induced fraud Zelle transaction with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Zelle in XXXX, XXXX / XXXX, XXXX only to experience exactly what is reported of within the CFPB XX/XX/XXXX court case against EWS / XXXX XXXX ( identified above ). The answer were the blanket I authorized the transaction, no help or return of funds even though the bank and Zelle report they are safe and secure and in the event of an imposter scam or fraud we are eligible for reimbursement as stated on XXXX website. I doubt that XXXX. / XXXX XXXX Zelle even cared about or took the time to read my report about the crime. Not to mention the banks let these criminals into their banks not us. Please read the attached to see a copy of the statements from Zelle about reimbursements which we looked into on their website prior to ever considering Zelling these funds. 

But for Zelle 's and the Banks comments of reimbursing and safe and secure promises and the Banks "" Know Your Client '' requirements under the law we would NEVER had Zelled or wired funds to their bad actor/ criminal customers they are allowing into their banks as customers. 

Why were we not told about these findings in the next paragraphs as this is what has happened to us as well? : The CFPB alleges widespread consumer losses since Zelles XXXX launch due to the platforms and the defendant banks failure to implement appropriate fraud prevention and detection safeguards. The CFPB alleges that XXXX  XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and Early Warning Services violated federal law through critical failures including : - Leaving the door open to scammers : Zelles limited identity verification methods have allowed bad actors to quickly create accounts and target Zelle users. 

- Allowing repeat offenders to hop between banks : Early Warning Services and the defendant banks were too slow to restrict and track criminals as they exploited multiple accounts across the network. Banks did not share information about known fraudulent transactions with other banks on the network. As a result, bad actors could carry out repeated fraud schemes across multiple institutions before being detected, if they were detected at all. 

- Ignoring red flags that could prevent fraud : Despite receiving hundreds of thousands of fraud complaints, the defendant banks have failed to use this information to prevent further fraud. They also allegedly violated the Zelle Networks own rules by not reporting fraud incidents consistently or on time.

- Abandoning consumers after fraud occurred : Despite obligations under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E, the defendant banks failed to properly investigate Zelle customer complaints and take appropriate action for certain types of fraud and errors."

Despite successfully redeeming the gift card after encountering several errors, I faced an unexpected obstacle when prompted to fill out a verification form by Google in order to utilize the credited balance. 

Compliant with the instructions provided, I submitted the required form and awaited further instructions. Regrettably, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a notification from Google indicating that due to identified inconsistencies between my account and the provided information, assistance in redeeming the gift card would not be feasible. The communication concluded without offering any avenue for appeal or resolution, effectively barring access to the funds I had legitimately allocated for use. 

The essence of my concern lies not just in the inability to utilize the redeemed balance, but in the broader implications of being deprived of a service for which I have already paid. This situation is particularly distressing given the absence of a clear recourse or mechanism for addressing what appears to be a misunderstanding or administrative error. 

In light of these circumstances, I am reaching out to request your immediate intervention to review this matter. It is my hope that together, we can identify a satisfactory resolution that respects the value and intent of my initial purchase. The inability to access funds rightfully mine, without a transparent and fair process to address such issues, raises significant concerns. 

I am more than willing to provide any additional information or documentation required to facilitate a review of this case. Your prompt attention and assistance in rectifying this issue would be greatly appreciated, as it not only affects my current situation but also impacts my confidence in future transactions."

I purchased a {$2000.00} gift card from XXXX XXXX gift cards. It was sent to me via XXXX XXXX in a sealed package. When I opened the envelope inside in XXXX, I checked the balance on the gift card and found that the card had only a {$40.00} balance on it. I immediately contacted XXXX XXXX. They researched and found that the card had been used for numerous PayPal transactions between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. The XXXX XXXX representative suggested that I contact PayPal, which I did immediately. 

I spoke with a PayPal representative, who opened up a case with the case ID XXXX . They were able to verify each of the fraudulent charges and told me that the name of the person who made the charges was XXXX XXXX. I had received documentation from XXXX XXXX which outlined each transaction 's date, payee, amount, and transaction number. We matched up all of these with the information that PayPal had. I was advised that PayPal would investigate further. Because this was a gift card, upon verification of the fraud PayPal would issue a refund to XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX would reissue the refund to me. I was advised that this could take some time. 

XXXX XXXX did issue a new gift card, but it was {$240.00} short of the expected amount. I made numerous calls to both XXXX XXXX and PayPal. I was initially told that it may take a little longer for all of the refunds to come through. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I was finally able to get through to speak to a representative. With the help of her supervisor, the representative was able to verify that PayPal erroneously neglected to refund one transaction that occurred on XX/XX/XXXX and was posted on XX/XX/XXXX. This was listed as PAYPAL XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$240.00}. The representative gave me another reference number for that transaction, which was XXXX. We spoke about how much time this was taking without me getting a refund. The representative assured me that she would expedite it and gave me a new Case ID number : XXXX. 

I continued to check with XXXX XXXX when I did not receive this refund. During this time, I also went online to the PayPal site to try to resolve this. There was an option to get a callback from a PayPal representative. I did this several times, but never received a callback. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with a PayPal representative named XXXX. She also connected me to her supervisor, XXXX. XXXX informed me that because so much time had passed, PayPal would not be refunding my money. I told him that this was unacceptable, as I had filed my complaint immediately. It was PayPal 's error that this transaction was not included in the original refund, and I had spent months trying to get it resolved through them. I asked to speak with his supervisor. After being placed on hold for an extremely long time, he told me that a supervisor was not available. I requested that he have a supervisor call me the next day. I have never received a call.

What I sent out from that was {$210.00}. I then received another check for {$200.00} which I deposited and the {$210.00} dollars was refunded back but with a {$36.00} cancel charge.the next day I send {$170.00} to vendor. The next day I had to send {$500.00} to two vendors but one of them was refunded back at {$460.00} because of a canceled charge. And finally {$130.00} to the last vendor of the day. I then took the XXXX that was owed to me at the start and told them that I didnt not want to Continue deposit checks because I do not feel comfortable. They reassured me that it was going to be fine and that with the next deposit I have a {$200.00} bonus with it. I then take out the {$200.00} from that check once it was deposited and the next day my account was on hold and that I have a XXXX dollars charge on it. I then tell her that I think Im being scammed but I just got brushed off the last time I called. I then asked would I have to pay for it. She then stated that I would have to and that the bank would take care of it. But when I went up today to the bank they said I would have 30 days to pay it off before my account is closed and credited

13100288,"TD BANK APPEARS TO BE IN VIOLATION OF THEIR U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE COURT ORDERED CRIMINAL SENTENCING AGREEMENT? A TD BANK MUST READ!

This report and its attachments will detail how I have experienced first-hand that TD Bank is using a/or the like rinse and repeat cycle of illegality ( employee and/or bad actor customers fraud / scammers ) at a cost to me of theft from TD Bank in the amount of {$84000.00} ( wired from XXXX XXXX of {$21000.00} to TD Bank on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and a wire of {$62000.00} to TD Bank on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX. During my research I have uncovered evidence that strongly supports that TD Bank and its bank employees is, has and continues to allow criminals to operate within TD Bank to include what appears to be bank employees continuing to help open up accounts for malicious bad actor criminals even after TD Bank plead guilty in XXXX, and now is a convicted criminal. 

Furthermore, I am stunned to learn many times the banks position of court convictions and fines are coined as "" just the cost of doing business '', all of which in my case has resulted in a financial harm and emotional distress to an innocent customer who trusted the banks word that the banks services are safe and secure would be an understatement. 

Until these bankers GO TO PRISON this will continue so all that read this need to help get the word out and demand justice does not stop at fines but also must include PRISON time for the convicted criminal bankers as fines obviously are not deterring the Bankers to engage in crimes. 

TD Banks XXXX multi-billion dollar conviction sentencing agreement/s mandates that TD Bank XXXX XXXX XXXX to commit NO FURTHER CRIMES ; ''. TD Bank should look into what that means to violate a sentencing agreement ( see link below regarding your criminal conviction ). 

It would be wise to pass this complaint on to anyone in TD Bank who is responsible for compliance with the criminal case identified below and take the facts herein to return/ reimburse me in full the money stolen by you, your employees and/or your customers. 

I am sickened to have learned only after the fact of theft of {$84000.00} that TD Bank is a convicted criminal bank with convicted criminal employees who conspired and schemed crimes with criminals internationally for a decade and I have experienced first-hand it appears that the bank continues to allow/ support criminals in their bank to XXXX/ steal / commit fraud and scams against other innocent banking customer ( see the attached "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). 

Key takeaways if TD Bank fails to make me whole / return / reimburse the money stolen in the amount of {$84000.00} to me : First, understand, I am not going away until I am made whole! 

I will be forced to reach out to ALL authorities and attorneys involved with TD Banks criminal conviction case for help and have them look into if TD Bank is in violation of their sentencing agreement. 

I will seek to have the prosecution team and/or other authorities to classify these crimes as but not limited to "" Conduct beyond the offense of conviction : Actions that are part of a larger scheme or plan, even if they don't directly relate to the offense for which the defendant was convicted '' or the like or bring a new case for violation of the original case or new violations of law/s and add me to the victims and remedies list to be awarded damages, fines, fees, interest, pain and suffering and other such remedy/ies the court deems appropriate. 

CFPB Director XXXX XXXX sums it all up : This is about financial institutions fulfilling their basic obligations to protect customers money and help fraud victims recover their losses. 

U.S. House and Senate clarified that the banks are to share the liability : The U.S. Protecting Consumers from Payment Scams Act ( H.R. 9303 pdf file attached ) introduced several significant amendments to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ) aimed at enhancing consumer protections and ensuring greater accountability among financial institutions to include a shared liability provision wherein the financial institution holding the consumers account and the institution receiving the fraudulent transfer with discretion to include other firms that materially help facilitate the payments to share responsibility for reimbursing the consumer to encourage all parties involved to adopt more robust fraud prevention measures. 

Note : See also the attached file titled "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' ( fraud Insights report ). 

TD BANK has the full capability to simply follow the money trail to the next account and the next etc. to reimburse the bank 's fraud victims : Due to but not limited to TD Bank and bank employees guilty criminal convictions the bank knows first-hand they must follow the money trail to claw it back.

Of Importance is that TD Bank was an active participant in the crimes and understand because of the practice where the criminal bankers/ the malicious bad actor bank customer will open an account to be used to receive money only to soon after move the majority of the ill-gotten funds out of the account to another account for obvious reasons ( i.e. bank freezing account or hold harmless recall / claw back ). This means the bank/s MUST but not limited to follow the money trail to make a victim whole. In the alternative TD bank has the option to simply reimburse me in full out of bank funds! Either way, if I am not made whole I will seek restitution through but not limited to authorities and/or the sentencing court / U.S. DOJ to include fines, penalties and other damages.

TD Banks XX/XX/XXXX Shareholder meeting just publicly admitted the convicted bank criminals caused extraordinary pain, the darkest day for the bank and that they encourage accountability and to be more curious about all these issues. Can you imagine the shareholders ' response and the U.S. Governments to learn yet again crimes are being committed within the bank and possibly another case is brought against the bank or sentencing violations are uncovered? 

Employing options to reimburse me identified herein or by any and all means at the banks disposal in the end is the least costly option for TD Bank as it saves the bank/s time and money as court/s, government agencies or the court of public opinion via media exposure will certainly cost the bank far more than just money as the time and attention this matter will require so many of your banks employees to answer but not limited to the courts, the agency/ies overseeing the bank is in compliance of their criminal sentencing agreements or to bring new charges, fines and cost to make victims whole to include going to the media, U.S. Senate / Congress and several additional agencies listed herein / within the court case TD Bank plead guilty to. Not to mention any employees that are found to be helping these criminals may be charged and maybe even a PRISON sentence!

Obviously the media will be all over this story ( to include XXXX and others who reported on the cases against XXXX XXXX and TD Bank in the past )! 

Furthermore, should TD Bank fail to make me whole read below of additional steps I will perform to protect my family from the harm TD Bank has caused me and/or the harm the banks customers have threaten me with by offering the details of the entirety of the my complaints/ reports which will also include the banks responses- all points to TD Bank continuing to support bad actors ( who are your bank customers ) and their international ecosystem team of bad actors will learn first-hand how TD Bank has been publicly noted as the bank of choice for criminal actors with bank employees who work with and support the criminal customers.

The nearly one million banking victims including myself are not the ones who : 1 ) pretended to vet the bad actors opening bank accounts 2 ) failed to keep criminal employees out of the banks employ 3 ) failed to implement sufficient anti-fraud measures 4 ) failed to "" Know Your Clients '' 5 ) used limited and ineffective authentication / verification requirements any or all of which resulted in the banks opening their doors and letting the criminals into the banks. But for the bank 's negligence nearly one million honest customers including myself could never have become victims of induced fraud or authorized fraud.

Nothing can come from fraud or theft but fraud or theft so wherever the money was moved from and then too is part of the crime money mule ecosystem and the account holder/s of the next account is part of the criminal ecosystem. 

XXXX XXXX just reported TD Bank will continue to be required to retain an independent monitor as part of the XXXX XXXX dollar settlement due to the bank 's failure to prevent money laundering plea ( the bank also conspired as a criminal in the crimes ) as stated by the U.S. DOJ. 

I am HORRIFIED to have learned after the fact that TD Bank has a CRIMINAL RECORD and by their own pleading of GUILTY has a reputation of lacking security policies allowing criminals into their bank/s as well as bank employees on the take working as criminals and supporting the criminal customers wherein the bank became a criminal themselves as evidenced in the court case TD Bank plead guilty to in late XXXX, labeled as a historic crime spanning nearly a decade. The bank is to pay nearly XXXX XXXX dollars in fines/ penalties : XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX In the words of TD Bank 's own employees : the banks XXXX failures made it convenient for criminals.

Within the case it is basically said the banks are to be the first line of defense against crimes not to be a criminal themselves, and By making its services convenient for criminals, TD Bank became one, said Attorney General XXXX XXXX XXXX. Today, TD Bank also became the largest bank in U.S. history to plead guilty to Bank Secrecy Act program failures, and the first US bank in history to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering.TD Bank chose profits over compliance with the law And, these failures made the bank an easy target for the bad guys. These failures also allowed corrupt bank employees to facilitate a criminal And, The bank was aware of these risks and failed to take steps to protect against them, including for two networks prosecuted in New Jersey and elsewhere And, TD Bank became the bank of choice for multiple money laundering organizations and criminal actors and processed hundreds of millions of dollars in money laundering transactions. 

And, Let me be clear : our investigation continues, and no individual involved in TD Banks illegal conduct is off limits. 

TD Bank 's involvement in this historic money laundering scandal included several bank employees supporting the international crimes and schemes. It was found that their lack of security policies contributed to a climate as a bank of choice for but not limited to corrupt employees, criminals/ bad actors / money mules/ fraud / induced fraud / authorized fraud crimes. 

Today it seems TD Bank is and continues to be a known safe haven for money mules and criminals alike of which I am now another victim of TD Banks failure to be a secure bank and instead is a known bank of and for bad actors/ criminals with corrupt criminal bank employees who work with and support bad actor criminal customers. 

During my investigation into the theft of {$84000.00} by TD Banks criminal employees and/or customers I have found what appears to show that TD Bank continues to have a problem with criminals operating in their bank and/or corrupt employees helping the money mule criminals open accounts. The criminal case TD Bank plead guilty to exposes the bank has operated with criminals in a similar way, in summary : The Charges : TD Bank 's U.S. unit faced charges for failing to maintain proper anti-money laundering ( AML ) controls for nearly a decade, from XXXX to XXXX. 

The Failure : Prosecuto

rs stated that the bank 's "" long-term, pervasive, and systemic deficiencies '' in its AML policies allowed criminals to launder money through its branches. Examples of The Money Laundering : - One money laundering network, with the help of bribed employees, processed mo

I would like to ask why and how is it not required by law, policy or otherwise requiring banks to inform and warn customers of danger when a sending or receiving bank sends a wire / EFT 's / ACH money to any bank / institution that has a criminal record, criminal employees and/or a conviction of like kind instead of as it is now the bank/s carry on declaring to customers they are safe and secure?

Furthermore, XXXX XXXX 's failure to do so caused me to a financial injury in the amount of {$84000.00} as well as threats of being harmed by a convicted criminal, TD Bank and its criminal bank employees and customer/s which has caused financial and emotional distress to me and my family that will last us a lifetime."

13250517,"WELLS FARGO IS PARTICIPATING WITH CONVICTED CRIMINAL BANK/S! BY FAILING TO WARN CUSTOMERS OF XXXX XXXX  CONVICTED CRIMINAL RECORD AND XXXX 's OVERWHELMING LONG STANDIG FRAUD KEPT HIDDEN TO CUSTOMERS/ THE PUBLIC CAUSED ME EMOTIONAL AND A FINANCIAL HARM OF {$92000.00}. 

This report and its attachments will detail how I have learned and experienced first-hand that Wells Fargo XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX and XXXX / XXXX  are using a/or the like rinse and repeat cycle of illegality ( employee and/or bad actor customers fraud / scammers ) at a cost to me of theft from XXXX XXXX, a convicted criminal enterprise , in the amount of {$84000.00} ( wired from Wells Fargo of {$21000.00} to XXXX XXXX  on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and a wire of {$62000.00} to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of {$7900.00} XXXX 

During my research I have uncovered evidence that strongly supports that XXXX XXXX  and its bank employees is, has and continues to allow criminals to operate within XXXX XXXX to include what appears to be bank employees continuing to help open up accounts for malicious bad actor criminals even after XXXX XXXX plead guilty in XXXX, and now is a convicted criminal. Wells Fargo has been convicted of crimes as well and it's important to note that Wells Fargo failed to protect me from the convicted criminal known as XXXX XXXX 

Furthermore, I am stunned to learn that when banks like Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX  are convicted and fined the banks and the bank employees being convicted criminal is, has and continues to allow criminals employees and criminal customers to operate within their banks that the banks position of court convictions and fines are coined as "" just the cost of doing business '' resulting in and at the cost of financial harm and emotional distress to innocent customers like myself who trusted the banks word that the banks services are safe and secure would be an understatement. 

Until these bankers GO TO PRISON this will continue so all that read this need to help get the word out and demand justice does not stop at fines but also must include PRISON time for the convicted criminal bankers as fines obviously are not deterring the Bankers to engage in crimes. 

First, I'd like to ask why and how is it not a law for banks to inform and warn customers of danger and that they or the bank customers XXXX send money to has a criminal records and employees who are criminals who support these banking crimes for a fee etc. instead of the bank/s declaring they are safe and secure? 

Case in point. My bank, Wells Fargo, should have warned me prior or at the time of any dealings with XXXX and/or XXXX XXXX and or any attempts to send money by any means through XXXX or XXXX XXXX XXXX should have had a full disclosure notice and warning of but not limited to the subjects and issues within this report or by any other appropriate method/s. 

Furthermore, Wells Fargo failure to do so caused me to a financial injury in the amount of {$92000.00} as well as THREATS OF BEING HARMED by a convicted criminal, XXXXXXXX XXXX and its criminal bank employees and customer/s which has caused financial and emotional distress to me and my family that will last us a lifetime. 

I am HORRIFIED to have learned after the fact that, like Wells Fargo, XXXX XXXX has a CRIMINAL RECORD which Wells Fargo should have warned me about wherein XXXX XXXX plead GUILTY and has a reputation of lacking security policies allowing criminals into their bank/s as well as bank employees on the take working as criminals and supporting the criminal customers wherein the bank became a criminal themselves as evidenced in the court case XXXX XXXX plead guilty to in late XXXX, labeled as a historic crime spanning nearly a decade. The bank is to pay nearly XXXX XXXX dollars in fines/ penalties XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX In the words of XXXX XXXX XXXX  own employees : the banks XXXX failures made it convenient for criminals.

Within the case it is basically said the banks are to be the first line of defense against crimes not to be a criminal themselves, and By making its services convenient for criminals, XXXX XXXX became one, said Attorney General XXXX XXXX XXXX. Today, XXXXXXXX XXXX also became the largest bank in U.S. history to plead guilty to Bank Secrecy Act program failures, and the first US bank in history to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit money XXXX XXXX  chose profits over compliance with the law And, these failures made the bank an easy target for the bad guys. These failures also allowed corrupt bank employees to facilitate a criminal And, The bank was aware of these risks and failed to take steps to protect against them, including for two networks prosecuted in New Jersey and elsewhere And, XXXX XXXX  became the bank of choice for multiple money laundering organizations and criminal actors and processed hundreds of millions of dollars in money laundering transactions. 

And, Let me be clear : our investigation continues, and no individual involved in XXXX XXXX illegal conduct is off limits. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX  involvement in this historic money laundering scandal included several bank employees supporting the international crimes and schemes. It was found that their lack of security policies contributed to a climate as a bank of choice for but not limited to corrupt employees, criminals/ bad actors / money mules/ fraud / induced fraud / authorized fraud crimes. 

Today it seems XXXX  XXXX  is and continues to be a known safe haven for money mules and criminals alike of which I am now another victim of XXXX XXXX failure to be a secure bank and instead is a known bank of and for bad actors/ criminals with corrupt criminal bank employees who work with and support bad actor criminal customers. 

During my investigation into the theft of {$84000.00} by XXXX XXXX  criminal employees and customers I have found what appears to show that XXXX XXXX  continues to have a problem with criminals operating in their bank and/or corrupt employees helping the money mule criminals open accounts continuing to rob/ steal / commit fraud and scams against other innocent banking customers, myself included ( see the attached "" cfpb-1 XXXX and Wires Wells Fargo Claims for XXXX XXXX XXXX '' and two Exhibit files in support ). 

The criminal case XXXX XXXX  plead guilty to exposes the bank has operated with criminals in a similar way and that bank employees are deeply involved in the crimes, in summary : The Charges : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX U.S. unit faced charges for failing to maintain proper anti-money laundering ( AML ) controls for nearly a decade, from XXXX to XXXX. 

The Failure : Prosecutors stated that the bank 's "" long-term, pervasive, and systemic deficiencies '' in its XXXX policies XXXX criminals to launder money through its branches. 

Examples of The Money Laundering : - One money laundering network, with the help of bribed employees, processed more than {$470.00} XXXX through the bank through large cash deposits into nominee accounts. 

- Another scheme involved five bank employees who helped facilitate the transfer of {$39.00} XXXX in illicit funds to XXXX. 

- A third scheme involved a money laundering network with accounts for at least five shell companies that moved more than {$100.00} XXXX in illicit funds. 

XXXX XXXX criminal acts and criminal employees does not stop there as recently yet another XXXX XXXX  employee, a XXXX XXXX who worked in XXXX XXXX XXXX anti-money-laundering department has pleaded guilty to a felony in connection with a check-fraud scheme and took possession of customers ' personally identifiable information. 

XXXX XXXX Attorney XXXX XXXX stated "" This defendant brazenly exploited her position for her own personal profit, '' and he said "" We take all fraud in the banking and financial services industry extremely seriously, no matter what form it takes. "". This case against XXXX grew out of a probe focused on check fraud. 

XXXX XXXX  stated in the XXXX XXXX DOJ XXXX case they plead guilty to that it takes full responsibility for its XXXX program failures and is making significant investments and enhancements to meet regulatory obligations and protect the financial system. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX Shareholder meeting just publicly admitted the convicted bank criminals caused extraordinary pain, the darkest day for the bank and that they encourage accountability and to be more curious about all these issues. 

I find XXXX XXXX is failing this obligation / accountability as evidenced herein and within my reports! 

XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX multi-billion dollar conviction sentencing agreement/s mandates that XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX to commit NO FURTHER CRIMES ; ''. 

It appears Wells Fargo is working with banks that appear to continue engaging in criminal acts/ behavior which means we must ask/ look into if Wells Fargo is in violation of their sentencing agreements too? The bank should look into what that means to violate a sentencing agreement/s. 

It's prudent that Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX  takes responsibility for its failures and make me whole, return the entirety of the wired funds stolen by the banks, banks employees and/or the bank 's criminal client/s the banks let into their business in the amount of {$84000.00} ( plus Wells Fargo XXXX total of {$7900.00} ). Transaction details and additional evidence of the induced / authorized fraud provided in the attached files. 

One remedy available to victims/ myself if I am not made whole / reimbursed is to reach out to every agency identified in the court case/s to investigate if Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX and/or XXXX XXXX  is in XXXX XXXX any sentencing agreements, court ordered obligations or any laws and to ask for help to bring any new investigations and charges against the banks. Obviously the media will be all over this story ( to include XXXX and others who reported on the cases against Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX  in the past )! 

The costs and time the bank/s will put towards defending themselves and answering all those agencies and the media, not to mention customers who learn of this will be far greater than making me whole in the amount of {$92000.00}! Then and only then will I go away! 

The herein and attached files being provided to Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX includes extensive evidence and support Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX of fraud ( aka induced fraud / authorized fraud ) wherein bank employees and/or money mules/ criminals within the bank/s use shell companies and/or individuals with fake names/ aliases appearing/ pretending to provide legitimate services the victims are purportedly paying for to make it appear as if the financial transactions are legitimate all of which has been knowingly taking place within these banks for over a decade which could very well pose a grave challenge to the banks if I am NOT made whole as I will be forced to report the banks as ( but not limited to ) described herein ( breach of court sentencing agreements are taken serious by the authorities and the courts ). This investigation could also reveal even more XXXX XXXX criminal employees and/or crimes! 

Understand if I am not made whole then even if this is classified by anyone as not the same crime I will seek to have the banks crime/s classified as but not limited to "" Conduct beyond the offense of conviction : Actions that are part of a larger scheme or plan, even if they don't directly relate to the offense for which the defendant was convicted '' and/or the like, or a new case of its own or whatever the authorities deem appropriate and ask to have any and all parties/ banks culpable enjoined as well as but not limited to having me added to the victims and remedies list to be awarded damages, fines, fees, interest, pain and suffering and other items the court deems appropriate. 

It would be advisable for Wells Fargo to call XXXX XXXX and work out a resolution as this is a serious matter and will be best settled amongst Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX. Failure to make me whole as mentioned will result in the authorities and media being brought in. We will target but not limited to those agencies and agents named in the media and on the court cases. As for the media we will reach out to those who have a history of following Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX crimes as they are the most up to speed and familiar with your crimes and reporting on them which will speed up the process of getting this out to the public I will also put out a request for other victims to come forward so we may present the list to the authorities mentioned throughout this report and to look into a civil case that will go alongside of any cases the authorities bring. Best scenario and least costly financially and on the public courts of opinion is to make me whole otherwise this is not going away!

10042620,"Subject : Urgent Request for Assistance in Recovering Funds from Fraudulent Job Scam and Denied Claim by Wells Fargo Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Team, I am writing to urgently seek your assistance regarding a fraudulent job scam that has caused me significant financial distress. I am a student, and the amount involved is a substantial portion of my finances during this critical period. I have exhausted efforts with my bank, Wells Fargo, to recover the funds, but unfortunately, my claim was denied after 60 days, leaving me with no resolution. 

Incident Details : On XX/XX/XXXX, I identified that a check I had deposited as part of a supposed job offer for a Salesforce Administrator role was counterfeit. The scam was well-orchestrated, beginning with an email from what appeared to be a legitimate company offering a job opportunity. I received a detailed job briefing and was instructed to install the Teams app for an interview. The interactions, including the email addresses and the individuals involved, appeared genuine and professional. 

After a successful virtual interview, I was informed that I had secured the position and was provided with a check for {$4500.00}, supposedly to purchase office supplies and a XXXX. I was instructed to deposit the check and wire a significant portion of the funds to a specified vendor for these purchases. This process repeated with additional requests for wire transfers for software and other expenses after I was provided with the checks for {$2600.00} and {$1800.00}. 

Checks were deposited to my account and below are the details : Between ( XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX ) Transaction Type : Check Deposit Amount of Transaction : {$4500.00} ; {$2600.00} ; {$1800.00} Recipients Bank : XXXX XXXX XXXX ( mobile check deposit ). 

I was asked to wire transfer the funds to the below account after the deposited check 's funds got available in my Bank. Below are the details : Between ( XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX ) Transaction Type : WIRE Amount of Transaction : {$1800.00} ; {$2600.00} ; {$2900.00} Recipients Bank : WELLS FARGO BANK , N.A . 

Each time, the funds appeared briefly available in my account before the checks were ultimately identified as counterfeit, resulting in a total loss of {$7400.00}. I immediately contacted my bank 's XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) check fraud division on XX/XX/XXXX, on the same day of identifying the check as counterfeit, and initiated a claim to recall the wire transfers. 

However, after a long wait of over 60 days, I received a notice from Wells Fargo ( recipient account where the funds were wire transferred to ) stating that my claim had been denied. This outcome is devastating, given the significant financial impact this has had on me. Despite acting quickly and reporting the fraudulent activity promptly, I feel I am not receiving the justice or support necessary from the bank in recovering my funds. 

Request for Assistance : I am respectfully requesting the CFPB 's intervention in this matter. I have all the documentation related to the scam, including the job offer emails, the counterfeit checks, wire transfer receipts, Consumer Report To The Federal Trade Commission and the claim denial notice from Wells Fargo. I will submit all these attachments for your review. 

I kindly urge you to review my case and take appropriate action to assist me in recovering my funds from Wells Fargo. The amount lost is a huge sum for me, and I am seeking justice and financial relief in this matter. 

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to your response and any steps you can take to resolve this issue. 

Sincerely, XXXX Date : XX/XX/XXXX"

Infographic : Cryptocurrency Scams : What You Should Know ( PDF ) Red Flag : Once the victim agrees to continue communicating, it's common for the scammer to ask to move their messaging to another platform, including XXXX or XXXX, "" Hey, do you have XXXX, lets talk there. '' They may use a different phone number from the one the victim may have been contacted from initially. 

For variants involving a professional relationship only, scammers may invite victims to join chat groups, where there are often many others in the same chatroommost of whom are scammers impersonating "" happy '' clients.

2. The Building of Trust Once initial communication has been established, scammers seek to deceive victims about who they are ( their "" persona '' ) and what they want ( their "" desires '' ) to forge trust with the victim. Tactics vary, but below are common characteristics of cryptocurrency investment fraud scammer personas : Excessive flattery Empathizing with, and often suffering from, similar life events as the victim ( e.g., if a victim is going through a divorce, then the scammer may be going through a divorce, too ).

Suffering from a hardship that requires help from the victim.

Sharing pictures, often selfies, of themselves. 
Offering to meet in person but making those meetings contingent upon the victim accomplishing a task ( e.g., we can meet once you raise enough money ). 
Offering to meet in person, but always finding an excuse at the last minute for why they cant. 
Expressing a strong romantic interest in the victim. 
Agreeing to some video conference calls but preferring instead to speak over text. 
3. The Pitch Once trust is established with victims, criminals introduce the topic of investing. It's common for scammers to say they themselvesor people in their family or close networkare experts in such investments. They may promise they can bring the victim in on "" the ground floor. '' Types of investments can vary, however common ones include binary trading, liquidity mining, and gold futures. 

4. The Initial Investment Once the scammer convinces the victim to participate in their scheme, the scammer will instruct the victim how to invest the money, as follows : Open a cryptocurrency account at a reputable exchange. 
Transfer money from a traditional bank account to the new cryptocurrency account. 
Convert the moneynow hosted on the cryptocurrency exchangeto the cryptocurrency type the scammer specifies, e.g., Bitcoin, Ether, Tether. 
Open an account on the "" investment platform '' provided by the scammer or an individual or group that the scammer directed the victim to. 
Deposit the cryptocurrency to the investment platform either directly or through a private wallet. 
Investment Platforms : Note that these "" platforms '' exist in the form of what appear to be traditional websites, either accessible via the web or through a specific browser only accessible via cryptocurrency applications. Common factors include : Registration using an email address or phone number.

Two-factor authentication ( e.g., a phone number + an email address ) to log in. 
A website name that closely mimicsor "" spoofs '' a legitimate site. 
A professional-looking site design that shows the portfolio in an appealing manner. 
A customer support portal used to communicate about investments and withdrawals. 
Did You Know? 

Scammers may use deepfake technology and/or hire real people to engage with you on the phone. Even if they're real people you're speaking to, they could be part of a scam. 



Cryptocurrency Job Scams Cryptocurrency Job Scams Cryptocurrency job scams begin when scammers, masquerading as employees of legitimate companies, recruit victims and require them to deposit their own money in order to complete the job. 

Red Flag : Were you introduced to the investment scheme by someone in person? If it was someone you know, it could be that they, too, are unwitting victims, and you should warn them immediately. If it was a stranger, and they pitched the idea not long after meeting you, it is entirely possible they are part of a criminal network supporting these schemes. 

5. The Growing Investment Once the victim starts to "" invest, '' returns shown on the investment platform will appear to be extremely lucrative, encouraging the victim to invest more and more. It is common in the early stages for the scammers to allow victims to withdraw not only the original deposit but the earnings as well. This is meant to trick victimsa means to reassure them that the platform is legitimate. Scammers use various means to sweeten the pot, or encourage further investing. Examples include : "" Matching '' Providing their own funds to the victims portfolio to help the victim reach an ( arbitrary ) investment goal. 
"" Scarcity '' Stating that returns or investment opportunities are only available in a short time period. 


6. Taxes, Fees, and the End of the Scheme Once the victim is ready to withdrawal all their earnings, they will find their account frozen and an arbitrary requirement will arise, usually in the form of paying "" taxes '' or "" fees '' to unlock their funds. 

This is a trap : it is simply another method used by the scammers to try and convince victims to invest even more money. 

It can be a particularly devastating point in the scheme, as victims will often pay more money to unlock their funds than any amount they previously deposited. At this point, there is usually nothing the victim can do : the scammers will never unlock the funds and it's likely they have already withdrawn those funds into criminally controlled cryptocurrency wallets inaccessible to the victim. In the end, the victim loses all the money they deposited into the scheme.

I acknowledge I got a number of emails, but I did call the Bank regarding these charges. I get so many email I can not get them straight; real or spam. 
Paypal claims we ordered {$2900.00} in XXXX gift cards on XXXX. It claims we requested and activated a debit mastercard on XX/XX/23. WE DID NEITHER! I never ordered any gift cards nor did I either request or activate any debit card! 
I provided Paypal with the case numbers and contact information for both my Bank, XXXX, and XXXX. Both XXXX and XXXX acknowledged I was scammed and declined to participate. 
The XXXX XXXX claim/dispute number is XXXX. [ XXXX, claims, ( XXXX ) ]. XXXX first notified me of this scam on XX/XX/23 and did not fund or authorize charges to my bank accounts for payment for XXXX fraudulently requested XXXX gift cards. They assured me they would handle the matter with Paypal-which they did. 
Yet, on XX/XX/23, after having notice of my bank declining payment, Paypal accepted, processed, and activated a debit mastercard ( # XXXX ). I never requested opening any Paypal debit card. Nor did I agree to the activation or use of any such debit card. Paypal refers to this card as a Paypal debit mastercard # XXXX. Our credit reporting agencies, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, reflect NO inquiries for XXXX, which would be standard for a new debit card request. 
Upon notice, XX/XX/23, XXXX, which had received an order for XXXX digital gift cards ( # XXXX ) did not provide an activation code and never activated any gift card. The XXXX case # is XXXX. Call them at ( XXXX ) XXXX. There is NO evidence any gift cards were ever activated or used! 
Our Paypal website documentation is opaque and confusing at best. It appears after XXXX Bank refused payment and notified Paypal and XXXX of the scam, Paypal opened a Paypal debit card to reimburse itself for the {$2900.00} the Bank would not pay. We can not ascertain whether the {$2900.00} charge to the debit card on XX/XX/23 was for a new set of XXXX gift cards or a charge to merely reimburse Paypal for the charges our bank rightfully declined. 
This entire scam began the evening of XX/XX/23 when I could not log into our XXXX streaming TV account. A telephone number appeared on screen to call ; which I did. I naively and foolishly answered a myriad of questions to the very persistent representative regarding our financial accounts and passwords. I never suspected the information on our TV could lead to a scam!

14821575,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was the victim of a sophisticated online employment scam conducted through a website operating under the domain empireonline.cc. The platform presented itself as a legitimate service offering payment in exchange for reviewing and rating movies. At the outset, the opportunity appeared credible. Tasks were assigned, and compensation was issued promptly after completion, which helped establish an initial sense of trust and legitimacy ( refer to evidence # XXXX ). 

This entity breached of Duty of Care, Violation of Consumer Protection Regulations, and failure to Adhere to the Best Industry Practices. 

As XXXX XXXX continued participating, the platforms requirements changed. She was informed that in order to continue earning and to fully access her earnings, she needed to deposit cryptocurrency into what was described as her account on the platform. Trusting the process due to the earlier successful transactions, she proceeded to send XXXX ETH using her XXXX wallet and XXXX wallet, believing it was a necessary step to unlock or verify her earnings ( refer to evidence # XXXX ). 
However, following the deposit, she lost access to all funds, both the amount she had deposited and the payments she had previously received. Attempts to withdraw her balance were unsuccessful, and communication from the platform ceased entirely. The process revealed itself as a fraudulent scheme, using initial small payouts to build confidence before introducing a financial trap involving irreversible cryptocurrency transfers. 



The platform empireonline.cc and fundschargeback.com has since shown signs consistent with a scam operation, including the abrupt disappearance of support and the misuse of cryptocurrency to avoid traceability. XXXX XXXX 's experience illustrates how such scams can exploit legitimate-seeming roles, drawing victims in through credible interfaces and early successes before culminating in significant financial loss. 
This summary provides an overview of the critical findings, and a preliminary understanding of the infrastructure and methods used by XXXX XXXX, to defraud the Client and other potential victims. This scheme follows a common pattern as seen in Employment scams. The findings below lay the blueprint for understanding the detailed Analysis that follows : XXXX.

XXXX Fraudulent Financial Webs The Entity Under Investigation provided the Client with various payment channels, purportedly to fund investments and/or cover fees. The examination of said channels corroborates the Company 's initial supposition, that these channels were nothing but Expendable Crypto Wallets. These channels served as initial conduits to launder the Clients assets through a complex network of similar accounts. 

The XXXX XXXX XXXX orchestrated a complex and sophisticated fraud scheme. This deceptive operation was carefully designed with the sole purpose of misappropriating the Client 's assets. The Entity Under Investigation deliberately engaged in Fraud, offering no legitimate services or value in return for the Clients payments.

Accordingly, this analysis seeks to identify the junctures that The Entity Under Investigation utilized to launder the stolen funds.

10632361,"My XXXX account had been suspended for my allegedly not following community guidelines on my XXXX account. The XXXX account listed in the notification was not mine. 
On XX/XX/year>, I located a phone number online for XXXX Customer Support. I called the number and the person phone told me that someone in OH was using my XXXX account to attempt illegal purchases of cryptocurrency and bitcoin. 
I was instructed to download an app that would broadcast the screen of my phone and record everything so I would have a record of our conversation. Under the guise of setting purchasing limits in each of my accounts, I was instructed to access my bank and transfer money from one account to another. All the while being reassured that no money was leaving my bank accounts. 
Then I was instructed to access my Venmo account, choose a person that I trusted and whom they could call, and make 2 transfers. The first for {$2000.00}, the second for {$2400.00}. I transferred these amounts to my sister. Someone then called my sister and provided her with a card number to reverse the money transfer. When I look at my Venmo transactions, it looks like there is a credit of {$4400.00}, but the money was never accessible to me. The transfer of {$2000.00} was successful. The transfer for {$2400.00} was denied due to insufficient funds. I went to my bank on XX/XX/year> to inform them of what was going on. A second attempt to transfer the {$2400.00} from my bank was made on XX/XX/year>, and also denied due to insufficient funds. On XX/XX/year>, I saw two more transactions one for {$1900.00} to my bank card, and one for {$2500.00} to a card that was never my card. I disputed this transaction, but my claim was denied because the transaction was made from the same IP address that all my other transactions were made from. On XX/XX/year>, I received an email from Venmo stating that the {$2400.00} had been denied by my bank for insufficient funds, but they sent it anyway! So now they are requesting a payment from me for {$2400.00}. 
My XXXX XXXX was impacted in the amount of {$570.00}. My dispute was denied for the same reason as Venmo. 
PayPalI was instructed to transfer {$1900.00} to the billing manager XXXX XXXX. My dispute was denied due to the transaction taking place through the me IP address, and had been sent under the friends and family option. 
While at the bank on XX/XX/year>, the bank manager assisted me in contacting each of these entities in order to file a claim. The number she located for Venmo actually put us in contact with another scammer! When I called him back he told me that someone had used my information to open a virtual credit card in Michigan, and had purchased {$2000.00} in gift cards. He told me I needed to purchase the same dollar amount in gift cards in order to show the bank that these 2 transactions took place within 24 hours of each other which proves fraud, and the bank would cancel them both. I filed a claim with each of the stores where I purchased the gift cards, but to date I do not have a response. I contacted my credit card company and was instructed to wait until the stores closed their investigations. I will be contacting my credit card company today, XX/XX/year>, to file a dispute with them. 
I have come to learn that this type of scam is called Authorized Push Payment fraud. The perpetrators of this crime create feelings of fear, confusion and urgency, all under the pretense of helping protect you from some other fraudsters. At this time, in the United States, it appears there is very little recourse as a victim of this crime."

Following these instructions, I scheduled and conducted an interview entirely through the XXXX XXXX XXXX on Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX. I was told my responses would be reviewed by HR. 

Several days later, on Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX, I received a phone call from a person claiming to be XXXX XXXX, another alleged employee, who scheduled a second interview phase for Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. After this call, I was informed I was selected for a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  position at XXXX XXXX. 

I was then directed to contact "" XXXX XXXX '' on XXXX XXXX, supposedly responsible for onboarding and procuring my work-from-home equipment. Meanwhile, I continued to receive emails from "" XXXX XXXX '' requesting my direct deposit information and various forms for my employee profile, which I completed and submitted. Notably, I was never asked for my SSN or tax information. 

Over the next few days, I corresponded with "" XXXX XXXX, '' who assigned me tasks and assessment questions related to the role. In retrospect, it appears this was an attempt to build trust. "" She '' presented herself as kind and understanding. On Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, "" she '' informed me I was on track and sent me a check via the XXXX XXXX XXXX, instructing me to print and deposit it using my mobile banking app. This process felt unusual, but I believed it was a requirement for remote work. I still possess a complete transcript of this XXXX XXXX communication, along with all other pertinent evidence and documents related to this situation. 

The check appeared to clear, and I was then contacted by someone named "" XXXX '' for an update. The weekend passed, and on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, I was instructed to make a wire transfer to the company 's "" authorized vendor '' for my work-from-home equipment. "" XXXX '' guided me through this process, which was entirely new to me. The wire transfer was confirmed as successful. Subsequently, "" XXXX '' sent me what I now recognize as a fake invoice from the "" authorized vendor 's '' webpage, which appeared to be from XXXX. I then received a second check and was expected to repeat the deposit and wire transfer. 

At this point, I became suspicious. I contacted my bank, PNC, who informed me that both checks were fraudulent and advised me against making any further deposits. The PNC representative indicated that I was likely a victim of fraud. Shortly thereafter, my checking account was completely emptied and overdrawn. I later visited the bank listed on the fraudulent checks."

7813089,"Chase Bank credited my account for the three transactions total but removed it after 'research ' shows that I 'could have ' made these transactions.

I am writing to submit my evidence that I did not make the three XXXX transactions on XX/XX/2023, to XXXX XXXX. The Chase Fraud Department determined that I could have made these XXXX transactions. I am attaching evidence I did not make the following XXXX transactions. 

Transaction number XXXX Time : XXXXXXXX XXXX  Amount : {$1400.00} Transaction number XXXX Time : XXXX XXXX  Amount : {$1500.00} Transaction number XXXX Time : XXXX EST Amount : {$2000.00} Evidence XXXX The recipient XXXX XXXX is an unknown person to XXXX XXXX He is not on the XXXX recipient list on my Chase account. I was not sent an email or text to confirm I was adding a new XXXX recipient. If I had deleted him from the recipient list on the Chase website, Chase software should be able to determine when he was added and when he was deleted. On XX/XX/XXXX I was in the Chase XXXX  branch meeting with XXXX, the Chase customer service representative and she confirmed he was not a contact on my phone. 

Evidence XXXX When these transactions were being made, I was driving on the freeway. The XXXX Department representative told the Chase customer service representative that XXXX XXXX and are on their phone all the time. Very true but I have evidence from my XXXX XXXX XXXX that monitors my driving habits that I was not on the phone at the time of the transactions being initiated. 

I have a screenshot of the XX/XX/2023 trip starting at XXXX ( XXXX XXXX  ) and ending at XXXX ( XXXX XXXX  ) which was the time the transactions were taking place. The tracker shows I was not on the phone. Also I have a screenshot of my drive to the office on XX/XX/2023 where I logged into the Chase app on my phone while driving at XXXX and the app shows phone use. ( see attached XXXX photos ) Evidence XXXX This whole situation came to light when there was an attempt to wire {$19000.00}, which was most of the balance of our checking account ending in XXXX to a person I do not know named XXXX XXXX. This transaction was rejected because of a phone call made to me by a Chase representative at XXXX ( XXXX XXXX  ). I told the Rep, he had my cell number and was speaking to me on the phone he called, which is my cell number. The Chase Rep asked me to call the number on the back of my debit card to speak with Chase regarding a transaction he needed to verify. I called Chase back, waited on hold for 17 minutes and ended up speaking with a Fraud Department rep later that evening. 

I do not know XXXX XXXX and did not initiate the wire transfer to her for that amount. Chase did not authorize the wire transfer. 

When speaking with the Chase Fraud Department Rep, in the late evening of October 17th she had me get another email account only to be used for banking at Chase, we established a verbal security code, XXXX security questions and a new login Username and password. 

After obtaining a new email address, I went back to the Chase website to update my email address, I then noticed the XXXX unauthorized XXXX transactions in another XXXX of my checking accounts. The timing of these transactions is suspicious. XXXX XXXX transactions XXXX after another to a person unknown to me or my family and a large wire transfer attempt a few minutes later. 

I called Chase back again on XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX XXXX  ) because the Chase XXXX Department did not open until XXXX XXXX  and notified them of the XXXX unauthorized XXXX XXXX. The XXXX then deactivated the XXXX ability on my account. 

Evidence XXXX I started monitoring my Chase account multiple times a day. I noticed the XXXX was active again on my account and that a new recipient XXXX XXXX was added and an attempt to XXXX XXXX was rejected. I did not activate XXXX, add any new recipients and this person XXXX XXXX is unknown to me. 

I then went into the bank on XX/XX/2023, after receiving a letter stating that after research, Chase could not determine I didnt make these transactions. XXXX at the XXXX branch verified on my phone that XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX are not contacts on my phone. Since I have a new login Username and password, I do not know how this person was able to access my account, activate XXXX and initiate the XXXX transaction to XXXX XXXX. 

Evidence XXXX In addition on XXXX XXXX, the thieves stole XXXX of my XXXX XXXX Rewards points and bought XXXX {$200.00} XXXX gift cards. I have the Chase credit card to purchase XXXX XXXX tickets with my reward points and nothing else. If Chase looks into my history, they will see only transfers to my XXXX XXXX XXXX frequent flier account. 

I am a victim of fraud and do not recognize, authorize or initiate any of these transactions. Please reconsider your determination and credit my checking account back for the XXXX unauthorized XXXX transactions totaling {$4900.00}."
9113040,"In XX/XX/XXXX, I was flagged as a fraudulent person by Home Depot, resulting in a ban from making any returns or transactions. Home Depot claimed my Home Depot Citibank credit card was under investigation for fraud and scamming. Despite never engaging in any fraudulent activities, I was humiliated in the store and treated like a criminal. Home Depot 's staff failed to provide any explanation on how or even why I was flagged, only offering a vague apology stating it must have been a mistake and a {$25.00} gift card, which I refused.

I escalated my concerns to senior leadership at Home Depot and stated my intent to cancel the card due to this unjust treatment. But, I continued to make monthly payments on my Citibank card, which had a {$25000.00} credit limit. Despite paying, sometimes XXXX hours late due to my payday schedule, I maintained a low balance relative to the credit limit. 

In XXXX of XXXX, when I went to pay my monthly bill, I noticed Citibank reduced my credit limit from {$25000.00} to {$3100.00}, bringing my balance extremely close to the limit and drastically increasing my credit utilization ratio. This action adversely affected my credit score, portraying me as a high-risk customer ( 99 % usage ).

When I contacted Citibank for an explanation, they echoed Home Depot 's language, labeling me as delinquent and irresponsible, despite my consistent payment history. Citibank 's representative stated that they had reviewed my credit report and preemptively lowered my limit, claiming I was likely to default on their card as well, since they saw I was having trouble with other cards, despite no missed payments on their account. The fact is I was out of work for 3 months and had a payment plan with my mortgage company and car companies and was doing what they told me to do, and unfortunately it still reflected negatively on my credit, because the full balances were not paid. In my anger and frustration over this unfair treatment, I decided not to make any payments in XXXX and XXXX. I let my frustration get the best of me, but this was the FIRST time since having the card that I have ever been this late. 

This treatment feels discriminatory and or very unjust. The decision to reduce my credit limit to my existing balance, combined with derogatory reporting to credit bureaus, has severely impacted my credit standing. Their actions seem punitive and intended to damage my credit reputation unfairly. 

XXXX was told I was very delinquent and never paid them, please see attachments from last year to current dates of all payments to Home Depot* they again stated because I was delinquent with them, that is why they took my balance from {$25000.00} to {$3100.00}. 

I seek the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 's assistance in addressing this unfair treatment and ensuring such practices are not perpetuated against other consumers, especially those that look like me."

Hello XX/XX/2024 XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX! I am XXXX and I will be happy to assist you today on your query. 
I apologize for the delayed response. When a customer sends us a message via this portal, the message is sent to the queue and is assigned to a representative in the order received. Due to a high volume, the wait time is a little longer than usual. Please do not disconnect the conversation. 
You can also feel free to step away from your system and you will be notified once we provide you with the resolution. 
XX/XX/2024 XXXX XXXX  I can see an active limitation ( XXXX ) has been recently placed on your account, this is restricting you from adding bank or card on your PayPal account. 
Account is restricted as we have received an early chargeback alert for this account, showing the transaction XXXX in this account done on XXXX XXXX XXXX funded using the card XXXX. 
For your protection, we have temporarily limited what you can do with your PayPal account. We want to verify some additional details on your account before we restore access. 
We understand that having limited access can be an inconvenience, but protecting your account is our primary concern. 
Account limitations prevent you from completing certain actions with your account, such as withdrawing, spending, or receiving money. In some cases, PayPal implements these limitations to comply with federal and state laws and they cant be avoided. In other cases, account limitations help protect against fraud or could be instituted because of seller performance.

Here 's how to remove the limitation on your account : 1. Go to the Resolution Center.

2. Under 'Your account access is limited ', click Go to Account Limitations.

3. Next to each step required to remove the limitation, click Resolve, and follow the steps to provide that information.

5. Please click on the below link to know about the acceptable documents : XXXX XXXX XXXX Thank you for letting us know that the card is closed or canceled. However, we need a card statement, or a letter issued by the card issuer which confirms your card details.

Once youve done this, we will review the information and promptly remove the limitation, thereby restoring full functionality to your account. 
XX/XX/2024 XXXX XXXX  Even though I do not recognize the transaction you have indicated above XXXX, I can prepare a card statement as you asked. I believe you want the statement of closed credit card. Isn't it? 
Even though I do not recognize the transaction you have indicated above XXXX  I can prepare a card statement as you asked. I believe you want the statement of closed credit card. Isn't it?

May I ask you, why you repeated what I typed deleting the transaction number XXXX? 
I believe this function should be chat system, which the modern technology is proud about. It should answer promptly. Since I do not understand this transaction number, XXXX, which you indicated, you have the necessity to answer promptly. The person, whom I believe and rely, send the refund, which he does not have to do by your claim ; therefore, you need to answer promptly. This is the fault of your company. 
XX/XX/2024 XXXX XXXX  If you can not answer promptly, I will report this matter CFPB because of the unrecognizable transaction number both from PayPal and my closed credit card, which company issues unusable reward certificates. 
Since I consider this is Chat system, I will start to prepare making report to CFPB. And I will refund the amount to the sender ; therefore, whatever you claim he did something needed to be refund, he did not do that. And I did not have any transaction, which amount to be {$130.00}. 
XX/XX/2024 XXXX XXXX  I have a question. You locked my account with the claim that I have disputed him. In this case, he is suspicious. Why do you need to lock my account? You need to explain this matter clearly. And you need to explain why I need to submit this XXXX  credit company, which issued unusable reward certificates. I am happy to provide the copy. So please let me know."

They ask me for another mobile phone # to send a code to verify my account as they can't use my mobile number for some reason ( for 48 hours -- the account is "" too new '' ) : I give them my work cell.

I login to my account later in the day and it says I can't use my credit card and that I need to call a number j. I call the number and it's explained to me that I must wait for a letter to arrive via US mail and verify a code I receive on the physical letter before I can use my card again k. I try to escalate this with various phone calls and am told there is no way around this I can log into my account on my mobile device and online. I can give citibank money ( pay my bill ) and they trust that it's me enough to take my money, but put a hold on my account all for a feature ( apple wallet ) I don't really need that much but was a nice to have. They didn't tell me they were going to send me a letter. I got penalized for following their process. I did the best I could to give them alternate ways to contact me and they didn't allow it and punished me for it. I fraudulently could have handed the phone to a random person and told them to tell Citi that it was "" me '' and they wouldn't have known better ; their suggestion that I use a "" secretary '' at my workplace is crazy. 

I'm not the only one with this issue. Citi has restricted use of my card and left me to receive a letter via "" snail mail '' all to use my card again when all I wanted to do is activate a feature I don't really need. Yet they are comfortable with taking my money if I pay them and otherwise I can access my account in any other way, provide a security word, email address, etc.

I paid for the gift card, but the merchant did not contact me back after receiving the payment. After trying to contact the merchant multiple times through both XXXX and direct messaging, there was no response. I decided to make a charge dispute for fraud/scam with my bank ( SoFi ). I mentioned everything to SoFi and mentioned I got scammed ; they denied my dispute right away. I tried to contact them multiple times on the decision, and they did not respond for 8 days. They responded that the decision was made based on an "" investigation '' that was done very quickly and did not present the option to reappeal. They insisted that the investigation was done, and they did not give any proof of an investigation until I contacted them again. They finally gave me a document that shows their "" investigation, '' but I am not able to open it due to it being locked behind a login that they did not share. I submitted a reappeal and they quickly, in less than a day, denied my reappeal. They again sent a document of the "" investigation '' that was locked behind a login that they did not share."
9157692,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I listed a XXXX XXXX XXXX for sale on XXXX. I was contacted by a man named XXXX XXXX expressing interest in purchasing the car. He reached out via text from a XXXX email ( XXXX ). We agreed on an amount of {$7000.00}, and he would pay with a check coming from his retirement account. He said he was out of state at the moment and would mail the check to me. Since he was out of state, he said he would arrange a mover to pick the car up from me and would include the moving cost with the payment for the car. This brought the check to a total of {$10000.00}. 

The check arrived on Monday the XXXX in an overnight XXXX  package ( tracking number : XXXX ), and I made a mobile deposit at Capital One into my checking account that same day. Prior to depositing, I checked all of the security markers on it and blacklighted it. Everything checked out. A hold was placed on the check but was released on the XXXX and XXXX, making all the funds available. He informed me the next day that due to a personal issue, he could no longer purchase the car and requested the funds to be returned. I sent {$4000.00} of the funds in increments of {$1000.00} to through my XXXX account via my XXXX bank account due to a daily limit on my Capital One account. The email he provided for the XXXX was XXXX and the recipient name that came up was XXXX XXXX XXXX. The rest was sent in XXXX XXXX through my Capital One checking account to email XXXX. 

On Tuesday the XXXX, days after the bank cleared the check, I checked my account online and saw the check had bounced, and now my account is overdrafted by {$8000.00}. Ive reached out to XXXX with no response. I contacted XXXX ( claim # : XXXX ), XXXX XXXX, and Capital One ( claim # : XXXX ), but all denied my claim. I additionally filed a claim directly with XXXX and am still awaiting a response, as well as an FTC report ( report # : XXXX ). I will be submitting a CFPB report as well. I still have the check and the envelope it was mailed in. The envelope also contained a phone number : XXXX. 

I was only comfortable with sending the funds back due to the security markers of the check being all present in combination with the bank releasing the funds. Ive worked for a bank in the past and know legally a bank can hold a check for up to seven business days. I dont normally make check deposits, especially for this amount. I believe if the bank wasnt able to verify the funds prior to release, the hold shouldve been extended to ensure the legitimacy of the funds. The day after I made the deposit, I called Capital One to see if they were able to verify directly with the other bank to release the funds earlier but was informed they needed to go through their full process. 

I wouldnt have made this transaction if I wasnt under the impression that the funds were good, and I should not be held responsible for a fraudster taking advantage of me. I want to recover my funds, as due to the amount of overdraft, I cant pay my bills. Lastly I filed a police report with my local authorities, XXXX XXXX report number : XXXX."
12511173,"This is a complaint about Capital Ones credit card division, with three components : 1 ) dysfunctionality of technical systems ; 2 ) dysfunctionality of customer service ; 3 ) a policy that incentivizes Capital One to delay the delivery of credit cards with limited-time promotional offers to new cardholders. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for and was approved for a Capital One XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXXXXXX. This card included a promotional offer that awarded cardholders XXXX bonus miles after spending {$4000.00} within three months of opening the account. This would be my second Capital One card ; I have had a XXXX XXXX from them since XXXX. Capital One has an online portal to track the creation and shipping of new cards, which includes a message saying that the card would be shipped to my address. However, the address displayed did not include my apartment number. I am positive that I included the apartment number in my application. Furthermore, Capital One has had my correct address, complete with apartment number, connected with my XXXX XXXX since I moved to my current address a year and a half ago. I went to check the address in my account and found that Capital One 's system had created a second, new address for me with no apartment number. I added the apartment number to that new address. I then saw that the online portal had updated the delivery address for my new credit card - but this time, the display showed my address with an apartment number, but no street number or street. I went back into the system and deleted the second address altogether, so that my original address connected to the XXXX XXXX was my default and only address. At that point, the online portal updated my delivery address for the new card to be the street number and street but, again, with no apartment number. All of these changes happened before the portal indicated that the card had been shipped. When the portal indicated that the card did ship, I waited for it to arrive. The system indicated that I should have the card by XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I still had not received a card. I called Capital One customer service, relayed my story about the address changes, and asked to confirm that it had been shipped to my correct address - specifically, that it included my apartment number , street number, and street address. The customer service agent said that yes, it did include all of those elements- and not only that, but that the card had already been delivered. I asked how it was possible for Capital One to have delivery confirmation despite the card having been sent by XXXX with no tracking number ( at least, none that that had been made available to me ). The agent responded that Capital One had their own internal tracking system, but without tracking numbers that they could give out to customers. Hoping that the card had been delivered to one of my neighbors by mistake, I wanted a few more days to see if the card would turn up. I never received that card. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Capital One to request a replacement card. The agent told me that their tracking showed that the card had not actually been delivered as I was previously told, but was on the delivery truck, and indeed had been on the truck for several days. The agent told me to wait a few more days for the mail carrier to deliver the card. I asked the agent to confirm once again that the address the card had been mailed to included my apartment number , street number, and street address ; the agent said that yes, it did. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Capital One a third time to request a new card, as the original still had not been delivered. This time, the agent told me that their tracking had marked the card as undeliverable because it had been sent to an incomplete address. I informed the agent that I had already called twice previously, been told XXXX different things about where the tracking showed the card to have been, and that both of those agents assured me that the address had been correct. The agent told me that their information had been incorrect. I asked if a new card could be sent by expedited shipping, on the basis that I had already been trying to obtain a new card for XXXX weeks but that customer service had told me repeatedly to keep waiting, apparently based on erroneous tracking information. I also asked if they could send the card by a company besides XXXX. The agent said that they would deliver the card as fast as possible, but that it wasnt possible to send it by a service besides XXXX. The new card was shipped on XX/XX/XXXX and I received it and activated it on XX/XX/XXXX. For some reason, my latest statement lists the opening date as XX/XX/XXXX, but I have documentation from XXXX Informed Delivery that I did not receive the card until the XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Capital One to request an extension of the three-month promotional period for the XXXX bonus points, on the basis that I had not received the card until a full month after approval, and only after making XXXX phone calls requesting a replacement card beginning on XX/XX/XXXX, and having been denied that request and given incorrect information twice until my third phone call on XX/XX/XXXX. I was told that I would have to wait XXXX more weeks to make a request to extend the promotional period. I replied that I needed an answer before that in order to plan future purchases. I was escalated to a representative who filed my request and assigned a case number to me : XXXX. The agent told me that if approved, my promotional period would be extended by XXXX weeks. She also told me that I would receive a response within XXXX to XXXX business days. I did not receive any confirmation by email or paper mail that my request had been entered into XXXX Ones system. There was nothing on XXXX Ones online portal that allowed me to track the status of my request. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the XXXX business day after making my initial request, I called to ask for an update. I was told that the case was nearing a resolution and that I would receive a reply by the end of the XXXX day period that followed my request. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the XXXX business day after making my request, I called to ask for an update. I was told that Capital One was working through a huge backlog of customer service requests because of a recent technical error involving gift cards, and that this was the reason for the delayed response to my request. She also told me that if my request for the promotional period extension was based on having received my card late in the mail, that 99 % of such cases are approved. Since that was the case for me, it sounded like a resolution was near. The agent told me that there was nothing I could do in the meantime, though, but continue to wait. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the XXXX business day after making my request, I called to ask that the case be resolved immediately. The customer service agent said that the case was still being processed and that I could not receive a resolution today. I gave my case number to the agent and explained that I had already waited well past the promised XXXX business day resolution deadline, and that because of a large upcoming purchase, I needed to know the outcome of this case immediately. The agent asked me what date I created the case, which led me to wonder whether it showed up in the Capital One system at all. The agent then said that there was nothing to do but wait. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was transferred to XXXX. It seems that if my case number was in fact real, it did not include any of the information that I had asked the Capital One agents to include in it, because I had to reiterate the entire prior course of events to this supervisor. The supervisor responded that my case could not be resolved today. I asked her to escalate the case to someone who could resolve it. She replied that this was impossible. I asked what the timeline for resolution was. She replied that she could not say. She also said that the XXXX business day deadline that Capital One had given me for them to resolve the case had been extended. I asked her to clarify why Capital One was extending their own deadline to respond to me. She replied that she couldnt say. I then explained that I was having serious second thoughts about keeping this credit card because of all the problems Ive had so far, including XXXX Ones lack of adequate customer service staff to deal with issues like this. The supervisor responded that there was no such shortage of staff and no problems with customer service infrastructure. Surprised, I then asked what her explanation was for the delay in my case, and whether it was because my case involved some sort of particularly difficult and time-consuming research. I had in mind the information from a previous customer service agent who told me that 99 % of cases like mine are granted an extension of the promotional period, and that this should not be a difficult case to investigate. The supervisor responded that she could not give me any explanation for the delay in my case. She did not mention anything about a backlog created by a technical problem involving gift cards as I had been told previously. I asked the supervisor what sort of resolution she had the power to offer me, given this unexplained delay with no timeline for a potential resolution. She replied that she had nothing to offer me and asked what I was even looking for. I reiterated that I was very concerned about continuing to do business with Capital One and was putting the ball in her court to keep me as a customer. She replied that there was nothing she could offer. At that point I told her I would take that information into consideration when deciding how to move forward and hung up. 

Ive decided to file this complaint in order to document the technical failings and customer service failings of Capital One and seek a resolution through the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. In sum : Technical systems that fail to : - properly populate a card applicants address to match the address on their application - check a card applicants address against extant addresses in their account - update the destination address for a new card after the cardholder updates the address prior to shipping - provide accurate shipping and tracking information for new cards - track complaints Customer service systems that fail to : - address the volume of customer complaints in a timely and/or reasonable manner - adhere to their own internal deadlines for resolving issues- provide consistent explanations for internal delays- provide alternative redress when violating their own internal deadlines to resolve an issue Each of these systems contributes to a situation in which the promised three-month promotional period is, in reality, reduced to an arbitrary length of time that hinders the cardholders ability to receive any advertised bonus points. 

The resolution I am personally looking for is simply an extension of the promotional period by XXXX weeks. But as I mentioned at the top, the best way to avoid this sort of problem would be for Capital One to begin their three-month promotional period on the date that new cards are activated, instead of beginning on the date that the account is opened. Right now, Capital One has an incentive to delay credit cards from arriving in a timely manner to new cardholders. With less time to reach the promotional spending minimum, cardholders are less likely to receive bonus points. I was denied requests for a new card twice on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ; only after a third call on XX/XX/XXXX was I finally sent a new card. And of course, I would have had my card much earlier if the technical systems were in working order."

13248989,"To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally request assistance regarding an unresolved matter involving my account with Chase Bank. 
Earlier this month, my Chase online banking account was compromised by fraud. Unauthorized transactions occurred, including the theft and unauthorized redemption of my Chase credit card reward points. Upon investigation, Chase restored the stolen funds from my checking account but has refused to reinstate the stolen credit card reward points. 
These points were earned through legitimate use of my account and represent a contractual benefit. Their unauthorized use was part of the same fraudulent activity that affected my bank funds. Given that Chase acknowledged the breach and returned the stolen money, it is both reasonable and fair to expect that the reward points, equally part of my account value, should be restored as well. 
The total of XXXX points represents approximately {$1300.00} in base redemption value, based on Chases standard XXXX point = {$0.00} cash equivalent rate. These points were earned through tens of thousands of dollars in legitimate spending. The XXXX points were split across two Chase credit cards, approximately XXXX on one and XXXX on the other, representing years of legitimate use. If redeemed through Chases travel portal or transferred to partners, they could be worth {$1800.00} or more. This is not a negligible loss. The refusal to return them after a confirmed account breach leaves me without full restitution. 
The stolen points were fraudulently redeemed in the form of 16 XXXX gift cards sent to my email address without my authorization. I did not request, redeem, or benefit from these gift cards. They were automatically filtered to my spam folder and remain untouched. I do not own any XXXX products, nor have I ever used XXXX gift cards. It is obvious, without a shadow of a doubt, that this redemption was part of the same fraudulent activity that affected the rest of my account. I have retained the emails as evidence and can provide them upon request. 
I reported the fraudulent activity promptly, cooperated fully with Chases investigation, and followed all instructions provided. Despite these efforts, Chase has declined to fully resolve the matter, leaving me with a partial recovery that does not correct the harm done through no fault of my own. 
At this point, I am seeking external assistance, having exhausted internal channels. I respectfully request your help in advocating for the complete restoration of what was taken during the breach. 
I am submitting this request to the following offices : Chase Executive Customer Relations Ohio Attorney General XXXX XXXX Consumer Protection Section Office of my State Representative XXXX XXXX Offices of XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I am happy to provide further documentation, including case numbers, correspondence with Chase, and evidence of unauthorized activity, upon request. 
Thank you for your time, attention, and assistance in helping resolve this matter fairly. Sincerely, XXXX XXXX"

I called bank 's costumer service for help, and they said this check looked nothing wrong based on their experience so that I was gave a false sense of security that this check was secured on my account at the time.

11270985,"To Wells Fargo Bank Reference : Roll back of all credits paid off on Credit Card Cash Wise VISA XXXX This is my second complaint about unthinkable event in the banking history happening to me and my only fault is looking for work after being recovered from XXXX XXXX 

This situation with XXXX XXXX XXXX was first in line before the incident with the cashier check, about which I filed my previous complaint. 

As usually, I was approach through my email with a job offer by XXXX XXXX XXXX, after posting my resume on XXXX. He put me through a job interview and hired me as a Customer Service Representative in a meeting on XXXX XXXX platform. 
After I have accepted and signed the Offer of Employment, the next day of our meeting, he offered to pay off all my credit cards balance as stated on the Offer of Employment, as the way to let me use my card to purchase for my work equipment. 

He gave me routing and bank account numbers and the bank name to use to pay off all my credit cards. I did and reported to him with all the payment confirmations numbers. After that he directed me to use my cards to purchase XXXX and XXXX to send to their software manager for software installation. As the available balances can not be enough for the equipment, he wanted me instead to purchase XXXX gift cards to allow him to make arrangement with the company software manager and vendor. I did purchase those gift cards with my Cash Wise Visa card and XXXX XXXX, and also {$2000.00} borrowed from my wife. All the conversations and details are on the pdf attached to the letter. 


I just want to mention that this company XXXX XXXX XXXX was the first offering me employment, and as I felt thinks are not going well, and I moved to XXXX XXXX which sent the fake cashier check to me. With This XXXX XXXX XXXX, I didnt have any worry because, they paid off my credit cards and I said to myself that my hiring manager will get back to me anyway. I can never imagine that I was dealing with scammers. 

In summary, all the clear details are on the pdf from the bank account to some scammers names. 

Now my concern is how you facilitate the system for him to roll back the money without any warning to me. Without any investigation. 
I am the one who call to paid off the card and for refueling for another purchase with this bank information. Before any cancellation you need to contact me first to know what about. If it was any criminal act, you got the right to pursuit me. I am Wells Fargo customer for over 20 years. This is not fair to help somebody to steal from me with your help. 
Kindly, I recommend Wells Fargo to open a criminal investigation on this bank account, given to me to paid of my credit cards, and afterwards let me refuel the card to deepen my debit especially with my Wells Fargo Visa Card. You need to let the FBI be involved to get to the bottom of this. You can not easily put this financial burden on me.

Secondly, I recommend you stop any collection action again me until we get the whole fact ; and restore my credit card to the balance it was, before you roll back the credits. 

Looking forward to hearing from you, XXXX XXXX P.S.-XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of all the conversation of the presumed hiring manager of XXXX XXXX XXXX"
9193310,"Hi my name is XXXX XXXX and I want to file a complaint with FOUND online business banking company who banks through XXXX XXXX. I live in XXXX and could really use someones help and guidance with my bank or be a mediator with my issue at hand here.
My account was hacked and taken over on XXXX XXXX after I received a call by someone at approximately XXXX by someone posing to be a spark representative. To give a little backstory before I go into what happened, this person hit my FOUND account first and then moved to my other accounts. First ill explain my three banks so no confusion, FOUND is a business account I get paid through from my job as a house cleaner. XXXX  XXXX XXXX is the bank my XXXX XXXX payments go into from my XXXX  delivery job and BRANCH is the bank XXXX  ""used"" to use as a bank to pay us our drivers payments.I had been going back and forth from Branch and XXXX  recently before this all happened and was having my payments go into there because I like how the app showed us our balance after each transaction purchased. I also had a job as a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX which I don't have anymore but was also having those check deposits go into my XXXX XXXX so I could keep track of the majority of my funds in one place. I also recently moved some funds around as I set up a few savings accounts with XXXX  and pockets with FOUND to make things a little more organized for to my personal liking which is why this timing of this type of hack and scam is very odd to me and almost seemed to me as if this person had prior access or authorization on me, has been spying on me, hacked my phone a while ago or used to work for XXXX  or XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  I bank through because I couldn't understand how he knew all the information he did. To begin On XXXX XXXX  all 3 of my bank accounts, email and XXXX  driver portal were all hacked into by this hackster. Nearly XXXX was taken from my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX from my XXXX XXXX  and XXXX from the FOUND account, all stolen via online money transfers.
The call came in as XXXX  delivery on my phone at the time and he posed as a XXXX  customer care specialist. This man took everything I had in my account with FOUND and my other two banks while hacking into my email and accessing my emails. He saw my personal emails, work emails, bank emails and somehow knew about my three banks even from the start of the conversation not to mention restricting my internet access while during the call. This call also came at an unusual time period considering just a month or so ago I reported to XXXX  that something odd was happening to my XXXX  XXXX  account because I wasnt getting any orders day in and day out for several months and wondered if there was a possibility of someone either remote accessing my phone, using my account, acting as me or using my app and taking my orders. I didnt know what to come if it and had all kinds of suspicions and theories as to what was happening to my XXXX  XXXX  account. They said it wasnt probable but they would look into it since my ratings were going down without me taking any orders. They said they would follow up with me and not to worry they would get to the bottom of it. Its odd timing only because this man made it sound like thats what he called about and made threatening suspension a likely outcome of my drivers account if I did. Also told me I needed to do a return order on the order I was currently doing because it was canceled and picked up by another driver. He knew of my location telling me to drive to the customers house to attempt order delivery. During the drive he tells me that my XXXX  XXXX XXXX  that I used that XXXX  paid me through was going to be closed and that I needed to stick to using my XXXX XXXX account from now on to be paid from XXXX. He read me my balance that was in there, a total of XXXXXXXX  and said he would transfer that to my XXXX  account and it should arrive in there by the end of the day. Not processing how he had that information or how he could get into my accounts he proceeded to guide me on how to return this order which I would be compensated for. 
Another thing is he knew about my FOUND business account. He tried asking me for my FOUND password which I couldn't remember anyways so couldn't give him anything to go off. Once I got to Walmart to return the two items, I told him I was there, since he told me to do so the call disconnected or he hung up . I called back with no answer all it did was ring. Immediately then I knew I was scammed because the call was not answered by a XXXX  customer care specialist nor did it have the XXXX  recording at the beginning like they do. I thought well there's no way he could of gotten very far since I didn't give him any valuable information but for some reason I had a bad feeling about the whole thing and instantly I had feared the worst. Called frantically someone I knew that worked at XXXX  to ask them if they thought I had gotten scammed since I wasn't quite able to look at my account since my internet was down and they had said ""yes that sounds scammy hopefully you didn't give them your SSN"" and I just said ""all I gave them was my DOB, email and last four of SSN and never thought they could use that"" . Only banks, work places, healthcare of that nature have your information like that and can verify that with you I thought. I checked into my account with my FOUND account once I was able to get online and he took over XXXX from my account immediately following the call and then proceeded to XXXX  taking out XXXX and then hacked into my email address later on that night around XXXX locking me out so any correspondence from either bank and would go to him. Also Later on that night around same time He changed my personal info in the bank accounts while also hitting my XXXX XXXX around which was the majority of where my money was and left me negative XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX labeled this an account takeover which was my first hearing of such a thing. 
XXXX XXXX  and my FOUND BUSINESS account has been nothing but difficult with communication at retrieving anything back in correspondence and I have had to do triple the work to get anywhere and having to re-explain everything to everyone each time has been nothing but a timely fiasco taking me away from most everything else in my life. Ive went to supervisors, managers, and then I went directly to the bank they are either partnered with or who they bank through and spoke to their manager and XXXX CEO . Finally I was able to get somewhere with XXXX  as they finally figured out what was going on after multiple escalations to dispute four big transactions to later resolve three of them. They still have yet to dispute another XXXX transaction that they forgot about. They've had to re issue another account takeover and hold my account up for two days while they do a dispute on this charge they should have done months ago but failed to do so or understand. Ive had to countlessly provide lengthy details because there is a lot that is involved but also because they would not understand nor relay information to anyone. This has also been a problem with FOUND and even worse with correspondence or actions to inform me or do what needs to be done to investigate or ask any questions even which is extremely odd almost as if they had their minds made up from the get go and nothing changes even with more information on the case. Ive gotten the same three emails and same three answers regarding their decision in the dispute each time even after more evidence and more explaining as they do not seem to understand either. Ive gotten multiple emails from different people asking to verify my info and then saying ""we haven't heard from you in over two days we will go ahead and close this case then and mark resolved"" after I emailed them more than ample times, also telling them all my points of contact when they would email me from all the different emails I had to make. This just shows how unorganized they are while not communicating with one another. No one gets back to questions I have or comments I make about their email. I had explained on multiple accounts that ""I had to change my email, this is my knew XXXX"" and its as if they never see what comes through from me. The emails Ive gotten always say the same thing too at the end after all my work I put in to gathering my evidence and sending it to each individual person, even XXXX  from the bank they bank through XXXX XXXX),I had sent all my evidence to on. First contact with her was on XXXX XXXX  . Then a supervisor by the name of XXXX XXXX  asked for the decision on the dispute be reconsidered on XXXX  and that's when I sent the really pertinent information over that showed XXXX  database of that specific order I was doing at the time this all happened and the name of the customer (as he (the hacker) has placed many of these two item orders before) all of which get canceled. How he uses the same fake name with multiple cards. I tried explaining that the customer shown is the person that called me and hacked me. That he is creating these fake orders to get drivers contact info and tries to trick them to do this return all while threatening suspension and then sending a code to their phone to be verified by the driver. That this has not only happened to me, that XXXX  has had complaints from multiple drivers of this happening to them. This was on the news, on XXXX  posts, all over online, XXXX  forums and he does this all over the country. I fell victim to it and they wont even reconsider me or my plea, the only email I get from this XXXX XXXX XXXX explains, ""the nature of the payment in question is an instant withdrawal via a linked debit card, in order for payments of this nature to process they must be initiated from directly within your FOUND account while verifying the pin associated with you account (which is not true because I have never come across this in the past) and that there is no indication that it was compromised prior to these transactions""."" There were no new devices that gained access to your account therefore ruling out your account was compromised"". I feel like there is something hindering FOUND from giving the money back to me that either they dont understand what has happened STILL and why it is that they wont even credit me during the process of the investigation nor give timelines or act on their word or follow through with follow ups, and have it go way past timelines or they frankly dont want to pay the money. They have not done anything they are supposed to do as a bank should do. From my understanding they are a pretty new online banking system. 
 All I can say is theyve been nothing but resistant and shut me down each time. Im at a point in which I dont know where else to turn or who to turn to since they have made it impossible to communicate anything at all. I am to the point of wanting to file a lawsuit against their company or organization and thought it would be in my best interest to start here first if anything. I cant let this go without trying everything I can to retrieve what was stolen. That was all my hard earned money and for them to deny my tireless attempts as if I have nothing better to do feels as though my words are falling on deaf ears as my plight to recover the stolen funds go unresolved . I am a busy person and this has taken all of my time apart from work since this whole thing happened.
A total of all funds from all the banks was well over XXXX on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  in all accounts from transactions I did not allow and no one was given access to by me and somehow this person hacked into them, transferred money somehow and left me penniless without a way to pay for anything. This was the last I ever spoke to this fraudster/ hacker criminal. The number that came up was an XXXX  number (XXXX) when the call ended but said Spark delivery on it when it came through. So I was assuming that is where the call came from. I have all the evidence you could need all I need is someone willing to hear me out, take my statements and evidence into consideration, and take the time to do the work as I have been.Someone that will have my back and protect my finances and losses as I have read their are certain protections in place for consumers and bank customers like me from banks that are not out to protect their own customers and frankly don't care. That I have rights too all I need is someone to go up to bat for me. _W_H_A_T_ The bank I want to file a complaint with while also reporting this hack/scam is now with _W_H_O_ FOUND Date of transactions needing to dispute are on:

 FOUND bank was made aware as soon as I could talk to them the following business day XXXX since this all happened at night. I immediately froze the account on XXXX  because This person gained full access to it and they were and are still unwilling to listen to anything I had to say nor would look at my emails or attend my calls. 
They didnt provide me with any information on what to do or what will happen, just froze my account to then later find out that I wasnt able to reach them over the phone with an automated message stating that because of the freeze they are unwilling to take my call. This went on for some period of time to then later still being unable to talk to anyone even after the account was unfrozen. They set a new recording up following that stated that all disputes will be handled through email and that they don't take calls regarding disputes, which was not in place before this incident happened. I needed to promptly speak to them as I had to make them aware that this hacker was changing my account info to a different phone number and email address (XXXX XXXX XXXX) and that I needed it changed back to mine so I can access my account again and regain some form of control back. The day of XXXX XXXX I made sure that they knew that if they got any call or email not from these said contacts of mine that they were not me since I didn't have control over my account anymore and didn't want them not believing me or not knowing who was the right owner of the account. Another thing is they hadn't set any further measures in place to verify my identity for that matter to know they were speaking to the right person. Who was to know if this person would call and contact FOUND reversing any measures I had put in place. 
It almost feels as if they are the ones at fault here as I didn't receive any alert or notification of transactions or even fraud alert and the destination of where these transactions were sent was in New York. I find it kind of funny and a major coincidence that FOUNDS bank (XXXX) is located in New York. What are the odds? Again Ive sent them numerous documentation and photos, screenshots , evidence upon evidence. Ive never made transactions of this nature with this bank of mine nor with any of my other banks and FOUND doesn't even consider that odd or fishy?
I have police report that I filled immediately stating the facts and have multiple evidence based reports of this crime and the incident this man is posing on innocent people. I am not the only one. So case in point I got scammed had only verified with the man my DOB and last four of my social and name and email.This scam has shown to wreak havoc on peoples lives and the money they take from people. I have been trying to work with FOUND since XXXX  and they continue to turn a blind eye on the situation as I am shedding light on it. I am just as puzzled about this whole thing as anyone and certainly don't understand how something like this can happen and feel like its partly the banks negligence, lack of security, verification set up and protocols put in place when things like this happen. Proper verification processes and means of protecting my funds could have possibly prevented such from happening. By the next day though it was already too late at that time for the freeze to even have made a difference. I changed my account number too but again too late. If I was alerted at first when these occurred I could have saved more transactions from happening.Them not following protocol or following up right away could have made a big difference but no they allowed so much time to pass by and for it to be forgotten about and the matter to have not been dealt with a sense of urgency and time sensitive things could have resulted different but Found only gets back to me when its most convenient for them after multiple attempts of communication and reaching out. I have more than enough evidence and have a full on case in which the police are trying to catch these people who are still doing this."
12354307,"I deposited a {$1900.00} check from XXXX XXXX into my Ally Bank account. The check cleared from XXXX XXXX immediately, but Ally flagged it as fraud and froze my funds. It has been over 14 days, and Ally has refused to provide a clear timeframe for when I will receive my money. XXXX XXXX has confirmed the check is valid and will not be returned, yet Ally is still holding my funds without justification. I have called Allys fraud department daily, but they refuse to provide a resolution. This money is for my rent, and the delay is causing financial hardship. I am requesting immediate action from the CFPB to resolve this issue and release my funds. 

In the pictures that Ive seen you will be able to see that last times I was able to deposit money into my account using XXXX it was XX/XX/XXXX. On the XXXX I began to call Ally bank to see if they could fix the issue of me not being able to log in to my online banking. Also Ive been unable to pay my XXXX car loan because I dont have the funds because of this hold. They been calling me and I havent been able to do much. The issue happened when I decided to use a check from my XXXX XXXX  account. I recently changed banks from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX and all this happened once I tried using check instead of XXXX payment because XXXX XXXX business accounts do not allow XXXX deposits only check deposits to personal external accounts."

XXXX should have multiple images of the thief at various ATM 's and at teller stations. 

Friday, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX Bank of America denied our fraud claim with absolutely no mention of the recovery of my remaining money ( {$42000.00} ) in the frozen XXXX account. 

Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX - We were able to contact a Senior Fraud Representative at XXXX. They confirmed that the XXXX account my money was transferred to, is still frozen and that Bank of America has not done their part to recover the money. 

Monday, XX/XX/XXXX - I contacted Bank of America to open a reconsideration and to recall all of the money in the XXXX account. I received this number : XXXX. Bank of America rep indicated that they had not reached out to XXXX to recall the money while they did their internal fraud investigation. Yet, in review of the wire history in my Bank of America portal states the wire transaction was "" Confirmed Fraud ''. 

Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX - I received in the mail, a second denial from Bank of America, of our reconsideration. That is revealing Bank of America could not have completed an investigation, much less a thorough investigation, to mail a denial 1 day after I requested the reconsideration. 

Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX- I have yet to hear from Bank of America about my money in the frozen XXXX account and it's been over a month.

I am entitled to my money while this is under investigation. I have never sent a wire transfer. As an acupuncturist, I never move this amount of money. Is Bank of America practices allow for this to happen without any safeguards or protections for their customers - not a phone call confirming, allowing wire transfers online, etc?"
6442984,"I received an email on XX/XX/2022 from PayPal saying that a request for money had been made for {$1300.00}. I then logged in to my PayPal account using my password and there was an invoice for that amount. To the right of the amount it said "" if you don't recognize this transaction please call '' an 888 number. The person who answered stated that a IPhone 14 was purchased from Michigan under my account, but he could refund my money. Since I was already on PayPal, he then used a program that I had to type in my name and the amount, but he said it had to be done in {$600.00} increments, and I had to be very careful when typing it in. But when I typed in {$600.00}, it came up as {$6000.00} ( I assume they manipulated that ) so then he said I would have to pay that back, and said PayPal banks with Target, and I would have to go buy {$4500.00} in target gift cards, and take pictures and send them to him. He then told me to look at my bank account and he showed that they had transferred the {$4500.00} back, but I was to wait until the next morning to finalize. I was awoken in the morning to a text from my bank that they had taken all but .09 cents from my account."
10220188,"XX/XX/XXXX under threat against my family I purchased gift cards and gave the unknown threatening person the numbers. He called me from these numbers telling me he knew what I was doing every moment:XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. I have been under continual treatment for XXXX XXXX XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX. I believed this man until I didn't, then went to my bank and then made a police report. XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, FL XXXX. 
XXXX Police Department, case XXXX, XXXX. 
I called XXXX and CitiBank XXXX, cancelled cards, told story.Both told me no problems. Called back the next day. Still had work to do with XXXX, Citibank said never processed so no charge, good to go. Right now, I think XXXX chose to count the charges as a mis post, but the future hasn't happened. This complaint is both about Citibank and XXXX, primarily Citibank. 
Since Citibank told me the charges had not been processed on XX/XX/XXXX, and my balance was XXXX ( so did XXXX ), I had called XXXX to give them additional info and found out that I did owe it, but they have a Consumer Advocate Line and something called Ethics Point. So I called Citibank and there began a process from XX/XX/XXXX to today, XX/XX/XXXX, where I'm told I do owe the money, no I don't owe the money. Security Operations people ( XXXX ) told me I absolutely don't owe the money, I'm a good customer etc. I get a letter I owe. I call, I don't owe. I get a bill, I call, their end is showing XXXX. I get another letter. This time the Security Operations Supervisor gives me a confirmation number, XXXX. Nominee owed. Get a bill. Call security Operations, I do owe the money, no such confirmation number. Every person I talked to I asked about a XXXX XXXX XXXX, none. I even called XXXX, have to deal with Citibank. Talked to XXXX people today. Was told by XXXX people, a person who could help me would call me, to keep lines clear. No call. I feel like a ping pong ball. I feel abused. The cancelled CitiCard is XXXX. CalledDept of zelder Affairs because I feel do psychologically abused and it is hurting my health. Just went through and erased account numbers. After calling CitiBank so many times. I've lost count, I can tell you that they don't record telephone calls, they don't always make notes, they lie, they transferred me from XXXX service rep to another on more than w occasions, telling me I was going to a supervisor or Advocate. Today I heard from both CitiBank and XXXX, they don't have Consumer Advocates. Their other modus operandi is to hang up on you before you can finish telling them what you need, and to tell you someone will call you back and they don't."
6693867,"This is to notify you of a very disturbing experience we had with Chase bank. We moved our accounts to Chase because we travel worldwide and wanted a bank that could be contacted at any hour anywhere in the world. In the past we have been satisfied with their service. One of our accounts is a Premier Plus Checking and most recently the branch we used was Chase Branch # XXXX on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX 

Why is it that Chase contacts me all the time to advise me of special deals, they text me, they email me and they have my cell phone number. With so many ways to contact me why would they send me a letter through the U.S. Mail to tell me that a Cashiers Check I deposited, drawn on XXXX XXXX, was bogus and that funds were being removed from my checking account? 

XX/XX/2023, Used electronic deposit to deposit {$2500.00} Cashiers Check drawn on XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXXXXXX to my XXXX XXXX  Checking account. Check was received from a potential buyer in the mail as deposit on a XXXX that we are selling. 

XX/XX/2023 Received email from Chase notifying me that check was deposited. 

XX/XX/2023 We decided not to sell the car to that party and canceled the sale. Naturally we would return their deposit. 

XX/XX/2023, We got a Cashiers Check from Chase Branch # XXXX on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/2023, Chase was notified that the Cashiers Check that we deposited was returned unpaid, returned reason : Altered/Ficticious. We, Chase 's XXXX XXXX account holder were not called by phone, not contacted with a text and not emailed of that status. Instead, Chase sent a letter through the U.S. Mail to advise me that the Cashiers Check had bounced. We received that letter on XX/XX/2023. 

I contacted Chase on the XXXX listed on the letter to call if there were problems to immediately stop payment on that check. I was surprised when told that I would have to go to that local branch to stop payment. Why would a supposedly international bank require me to go into a local branch to put a stop on a Cashiers Check that they issued? 

I called the branch to stop payment and was told by XXXX that I would have to come in person to make that happen. 

I went to the local branch listed above, explained the situation to the very nice cashier who then proceeded to put a stop on the check. She made some queries on the keyboard and said she just needed to get it approved. She returned shortly and she gave me a Service Confirmation form that stated the stop was effective XX/XX/2023. 

I left the bank and was halfway home when I received a cellphone call from XXXX saying I should return to the branch because the Stop Payment needed additional action. When I returned, I met with XXXX and was told that the Cashiers Check had already been cashed and there was nothing they could do. 

When my wife called back the bank to get further details on why a cashiers check was not accepted, she was told XXXX would return her call. He did not on the XXXX and when she contacted him the morning of the XXXX, he hung up on her stating it was not the banks fault and there was nothing he could do. 

We can not understand why a bank, who has many ways to contact us, would, when notified of a bad Cashiers Check deposited into our account, would choose to notify us by U.S. Mail making it impossible for us to stop payment on our check in a timely manner. Chase was notified on XX/XX/XXXX, our Cashiers Check was cashed on XX/XX/XXXX, and we received Chase 's letter on XX/XX/XXXX. 

We were scammed out of {$2500.00} because Chase bank failed to notify us in a timely manner when a Cashiers Check bounced. 

This experience with Chase bank has been very disappointing and not at all what we have come to expect from Chase. We will be filing a fraud complaint with the FBI and are totally disgusted by the sloppy practices and procedures of Chase bank. We will begin the process of finding another bank for our requirements. Our policy is not to do business with institutions with so little regard for the good of their customers."
8180685,"My name is XXXX XXXX XXXX & I am writing you to re-open my current investigation regarding claim # XXXX. 

On Monday XX/XX/2023 I made a XXXX transaction with a gentlemen I thought was selling me XXXX XXXX tickets & a parking pass for the amount of {$1000.00}. I was posting on a XXXX XXXX Ticket page on the XXXX platform. The gentlemen I was assumed tobe dealing with XXXX page was listed under the name XXXX XXXX from XXXX, MD. I have also included several screenshots from my encounter with "" XXXX XXXXXXXX '' via XXXX XXXX along with other people in the XXXX XXXX Ticket page group that ALSO was approached by "" XXXX XXXXXXXX '' regarding tickets. 

The tickets were to be in Section XXXX, row XXXX, seats XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. While talking with "" XXXX XXXX '' he informed me that XXXX would be the best for payment and gave me a number of XXXX to send payment to for the name of "" XXXX XXXX ''. Once I tried to make payment, the transaction did not go through, saying "" Something Went Wrong '' and to contact "" XXXX XXXX ''. Which I did, and he then gave me another number to use, XXXX for a XXXX XXXX. He informed me that should work and to send the money to that account. Which I did and payment went through. Being that XXXX typically goes through instantly, "" XXXX XXXX '' confirmed he DID NOT receive payment. To which I assumed maybe because it was a holiday that the transaction would not go through until the next day. To test this, l sent my fiancee {$1.00} to her XXXX account and she confirmed she received the money instantly. This was my red flag that I may be getting scammed. 

"" XXXX XXXX '' informed me to call the bank or XXXX and cancel. I attempted to do so and was told we could not cancel because payment already went through. I was told by a M & T representative that "" XXXX XXXXXXXX '' did in fact, receive payment. To which "" XXXX XXXX '' kept insisting he did not receive it. At this time, I began to investigate on my own and reach out to people in the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX to see if anybody else has encountered any issues while dealing with "" XXXX XXXXXXXX ''. And there were several people. I have attached severa I screenshots of other messages that people sent to me showing me their encounter with "" XXXX XXXX ''. A common thing I noticed is that "" XXXX XXXX '' kept saying the recipient was "" his partner '' and that was who would be receiving the money. In the attached screenshots, I have "" XXXX XXXX '' saying to send money to "" XXXX '' XXXX "" XXXX '', & XXXX XXXX XXXX. Upon doing more research, I found a XXXX XXXX in XXXX, XXXX, XXXX that works for a cyber security company and he had written an article about "" Money Mules '' in XXXX and how it was becoming more and more common for "" scammers '' to perform stunts like this. 

Attempting to contact "" XXXX XXXX '' some more after feeling more and more uneasy about the situation, I requested my money back as he kept insisting he did not receive it. He told me he banks with XXXXXXXX XXXX  so I called them and was told that on Tuesday XX/XX/2023, all of their transaction have been processed and there is no reason for "" XXXX XXXXXXXX '' not to have the money in his account. I kept insisting that "" XXXX XXXX '' send me money back before I take further legal actions. He told me "" How do I send it when I didn't receive it '' and "" You think am scared or something '?? "". And then he blocked me so that I was unable to contact him anymore. I also tried to request my money back through the XXXX platform, with no luck. I even tried calling and texting the two numbers that he provided to me to make the XXXX transaction and they appeared to be fake numbers. 

I am 100 % confident that "" XXXX XXXX 's '' XXXX Account was compromised and that I was never talking to a "" XXXX XXXXXXXX '' to begin with. 

I have attached in this letter several screenshots { and labeled them ) as it pertains to this investigation. was trying to buy these XXXX XXXX XXXX tickets for my daughters for XXXX and as of right now, I am out {$1000.00}. As a father of XXXX XXXX this is a tremendous amount of money for me to lose during the holiday season. I beg you to please understand where I am coming from in this situation and hope that my letter and attached evidence helps to solve this investigation."
8532424,"This person found me on a dating site. He faked his identity. His name is either XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, from XXXX, XXXX but said he was a XXXX XXXX, XXXX years old from XXXX, TX. He also sent me many fake photos and even a fake photo of his "" sick '' daughter. We became close over many months and he started asking me for money for "" job related needs '' as well as money for his "" sick daughter ''. I sent him money in the form of gift cards and BitCoin. The whole time he was giving me promises that he would pay me back He took advantage of my kindness and played off my empathy. He would set up fake meeting spots and addresses of where to meet him and then never show up. He used me, manipulated me, and abused me mentally, financially and emotionally."
14854703,"Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/year>, I was the victim of a sophisticated fake job scam that involved XXXX transfers through my Citibank account totaling {$3500.00}. The scammers posed as a legitimate employer, conducted what appeared to be a real hiring process, sent me fake checks, and instructed me to use XXXX to purchase remote office equipment from vendors they claimed were part of the onboarding process. 

I later learned the checks were fraudulent, and the job was fake. The scammers deceived me into using XXXX to send my personal funds. I filed a fraud dispute with Citibank, but it was denied on the basis that the transactions were authorized. While I technically sent the money, I was doing so under false pretenses and manipulation. 

I am now appealing Citibanks decision. This scam is a documented type of fraud acknowledged by the FTC, FBI, and XXXX itself. I have reported the incident to the FTC, IC3, and local police. I acted in good faith and believe I should not be financially responsible for being deceived in this way. 

I respectfully request that Citibank re-evaluate this matter and issue a refund or provide alternative compensation."
