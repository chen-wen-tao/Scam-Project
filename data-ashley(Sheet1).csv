11310670,"I was contacted by a company claiming to be XXXX, which presented itself as a legitimate employer offering remote work. The job involved completing sets and reviewing albums and singles. I performed the tasks requested and communicated with the alleged representatives of XXXX throughout the process. 
After completing the work, I expected compensation as agreed, but I was never paid. When I reached out to the actual owner of XXXX to address the issue, they informed me that their company was being impersonated and had no involvement in the job offer or the tasks I completed. 
During this process, I was scammed out of a significant amount of moneyapproximately {$13000.00}. These funds were transferred through transactions that I now understand were part of the scam, as the fraudulent individuals convinced me to send money under false pretenses. 
I reported the fraud to my bank, Santander, and provided all the evidence I had, including communication with the scammers, details of the transactions, and proof of the alleged job tasks I completed. Despite this, my claim was denied due to "" inconsistencies. '' However, I do not understand what inconsistencies the bank found, as I believe my documentation clearly demonstrates that I was scammed. 
This situation has caused me significant financial hardship, and I am seeking further clarity on why my claim was denied and what additional steps I can take to recover my lost funds. I have also reported this incident to law enforcement and would like assistance in resolving this matter."
11258229,"I was offered a remote job by someone acting like a big HR person from a known company. They provided me with documentation that was exactly like the real company ( Assurant ) everything matched up and even did my due diligence with verifying linked accounts. They provided me with a check and insisted i deposit because of the nature of work environment and the holidays. I called my bank XXXX and asked them about the check and that i felt something was wrong. XXXX advised me to deposit it so they could look at it however, the fraudulent person was extremely pushy for me to transfer funds to a fake vendor to get my remote equipment. I ended up sending {$5000.00} as instructed and once my bank alerted me i immediately went to Paypal for help and they said nothing could be done. So i reported everything to government agencies such as, FBI IC3, FTC and DFPI. I have all records, messages, documentation, voice recordings to show proof of the entire scam. Paypal said they could not do anything for me so i created a case in PayPal and i need help fighting it. I just want someone to help step in and stop this scammer from scamming other American people like myself looking for work in this economy. please help!"
11629506,"An email appeared in my college email and it was an summer internship offering. I replied to the email so I can apply and work to help pay off my student bills. We only emailed each other and there weren't any like interviews to be held but I just didn't think much about it. The person I responded the email to told me that a person who was in charge of the materials was going to message me and he would tell me what to get. In a hour, I get a message from the person that the guy emailed me about and the person introduced themself and start with listing the materials I needed. He/She also mentioned that they would send checks through email and that I would have to deposit the money and buy the stuff myself. But the thing is, when I deposit the checks, the bank institution that I use says it will take a couple of days until the checks go through. I told them about it and he/she says that they couldn't wait since it would delay their schedule time. So they insisted that I would have to send them money from my savings and then they would buy it for me. We proceeded with that option and it kept going throughout the month and one day I woke up and got an email saying my account has a low balance. I checked and I lost everything. All my savings, all the money from the checks and I was in the negative numbers in my balance. I called the bank and they told me that the checks I deposited were fake and I texted the guy and he never responded back when I told him/her that the checks were fake. I called the bank institution to report about the fraud incident, reported it to XXXX  and the sheriff. They all came back with nothing and I had no reimbursements."
11338911,"I got a XXXX email in my XXXX account for an XXXX XXXX  over the summer and I replied to the email so that I could get the role. They asked for my achievements and past activities to see if I had any experience and XXXX days later I was told that another person would text me and proceed with the payments for the materials for my internship. They sent me digital checks and I would deposit it through Bank of America and due to the deposit wait, it would take a week for the check to process through my account. Because the wait time was long and the schedule didn't align with them, I had to pay out of pocket. I XXXX them the amount of money they requested and in return, they sent me a digital check of the amount I XXXX them as a "" reimbursement ''. This lasted for a couple weeks and then XXXX day I got an email saying that my balance was too low. Once I checked, it showed that I lost all my savings and everything. I started panicking and tried contacting the guy who offered the XXXX and he never responded. I soon realized it was a scam and the checks were fake. I called the sheriff 's department and my bank to report a fraud case. The sheriff said he would investigate but he never got back to me after a few days of reporting. I even called XXXX and Bank of America and they told me they would investigate but they said they couldn't pay me back in a few days. I was completely devastated that I lost all my money."
11582419,"About a year and a half ago I was scammed out of a little over {$1000.00} through Zelle due to a job scam. I was avidly trying to get a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and these people fronting as a company sent fake checks in order to purchase the equipment for me to work. If ZelleXXXX  XXXX XXXX had the proper safeguards at the time it could have been caught early or even prevented. XXXX did eventually catch on to the fraud, but by that point I was scammed out of over {$1000.00}. They ended up putting me on a payment plan and claimed they see this scam all the time, but had no safety features in place yet ( which seems like an oversight )."
11913356,"I was approached for my XXXX XXXX XXXX  from an individual who claimed to work for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. My role was to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
I was provided a check in advance for my services for {$5000.00}. After cashing this check, a couples days later the project slowly began to be canceled in phases, with the school requiring me to send money back in waves. After first sending them {$2500.00} digitally, the next day the {$5000.00} check had reversed itself due to being fake. The individual ( XXXX ) continued to request more stating, but once I pushed back stating their check was invalid and they owed me {$2500.00}, they went dark and I lost contact. 
I filed a claim with my bank, Capital One, who ultimately denied. The bank encouraged me to send documented proof prior to this decision, which I did. I requested information on how they made their decision to deny me, and it turns out they never used the information I had sent them and simply made this decision off our brief phone call when I first filed the claim. 
Below I am providing a step by step timeline of interactions with a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX in California seeking my services as an XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX XXXX provided a budget of {$5000.00}. I suggested that only half be sent as a deposit, but XXXX XXXX insisted on paying in full by sending a certified cashier 's Check. 

XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX XXXX requests my name, address, bank, and phone number for check distribution. Several days follow and I have to follow up for the check to be sent. 

XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX XXXX and I continue to communicate back and forth as I begin the illustration project and provide first drafts. XXXX provides feedback on multiple occasions through text and email. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Check is delivered ( attached document for reference ). XXXX XXXX texts me immediately upon its delivery to inform me that the check has arrived and that I should cash it digitally as soon as possible. I do so. He states that the {$5000.00} dollar check has been deposited successfully and deducted from their account the moment I cashed it. My account was pending at this time. 

XXXX starts to inform me that the project is changing and less work XXXX be involved. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Receive email and texts from XXXX XXXX stating that half the project ( Phase XXXX ) is canceled. He requests an immediate return of {$2500.00} as soon as possible. My Capital One account currently says the majority of the {$5000.00} check funds are in my account as the remainder was still processing. XXXX provides a document supposedly from the school stating the projects Phase XXXX cancellation ( attached document for reference ). 

XXXX texts me saying that I should send a XXXX payment to the email of XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). He also requests screenshot receipts of this transaction. I send the {$2500.00} and provide documentation. 

XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX XXXX texts and calls me first thing in the morning stating that the project is canceled in its entirety, and that I should immediately XXXX an additional {$1500.00} to XXXX XXXX at XXXX. I received a second document that morning from XXXX confirming the entire projects cancellation, apparently signed off by XXXX XXXX of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

A check reversal of the {$5000.00} check had taken place automatically earlier that morning, and {$5000.00} was removed from my bank account sending me into the negative. Most likely due to being a fraudulent check. At this point, I have also already paid them back {$2500.00} of my own actual mone. 

I call my bank, Capital One immediately and begin to file a claim for a scam/fraud. They inform me that they received the {$2500.00} and it had been successfully deposited into their account, which also happened to be a Capital One account. 

XXXX continues to text for immediate updates and keeps stating that the {$2500.00} I sent prior did not process. At this point, I inform him that there is no money left in my account, and that their check to was reversed and I am owed {$2500.00}. 

XXXX slowly starts to stop communicating with light contact, but never fully responds to my concerns. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I follow up XXXX more time in the morning requesting the return of my {$2500.00} ( claim amount ) along with {$1000.00} owed to me for compensation. No response. XXXX XXXX officially goes dark and I never hear from him again. 

Capital One stated that I could provide any proof and documentation to help support my claim after my first initial call on XX/XX/XXXX. I provide Capital One with all text messages, emails, documents and fraudulent check via email. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Capital Ones responds stating that my claim is denied. I request documentation regarding how they made this decision, as stated as an option in their email. 2-5 days required for processing. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Capital One provides documentation regarding their decision to deny my claim. The email showed that they did not review the proof that I sent them and made their decision solely on my first phone call reporting the scam which does not go into enough detail based on their questioning. 

XX/XX/XXXX : After discovering that Capital One did not utilize the information that I provided them for their own internal investigation, I proceeded to call XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX personally to look into the matter. XXXX suggested that I email their HR team explaining the situation. As of XX/XX/XXXX, I have yet to hear back any information."

I was sent an illegitimate check to cash and then transfer the funds to another account for an organization that was "" Aiding the less fortunate ''. There were no warnings from Zelle. Before the check bounced the money was gone and I was out {$2000.00} and unemployed. I contacted XXXX and received {$10.00}, as compensation..my insurance company wouldn't help because it wasn't technically a "" theft '' but I consider this a theft as well as the police. I filed a police claim and provided them the names and information and took this back to insurance who still said they could do nothing. This theft took place XX/XX/year>."

4516979,"I applied for job on XXXX for an XXXX XXXX position for a school. The listing was taken off the website, so I figured someone took the position, however, a person named XXXX emailed me and said she would send my email to a partner for a XXXX XXXX job. The job described that I would be running personal errands and the money would be for donations ranging from foster care to invoices to colleagues. We exchange information and the partner of the school said I was to start the following week, which was the week of the XXXX of XXXX. On the XXXX, the first purchase was for a XXXX XXXX XXXX for XXXX, and yesterday for a XXXX money order which was split into 3 orders : 2 for {$1000.00}, 1 for XXXX. I got an inkling to check my bank account, only to see it was overdrawn. I called my bank and they notified me that the check bounced. I did further research to see if any other XXXX XXXX  jobs had the same format of wanting to have people be XXXX XXXX for approx, 30 hours per week and for a set price per week, and for helping donate to foster care systems, to which I found plenty. I also went ahead called the school district, XXXX XXXX XXXX to verify if they were the ones who hosted the job listing, to which it was verified they did not, but they did have it for a XXXX position which has already been filled. I went to the bank Friday with photocopy evidence of our exchange to show that I truly thought it was a legitimate job offer, and that I wouldn't deposit a fake check as a member who just got my account out of the negative due to being homeless and unemployed. My bank will not reverse the funds, even though the representative I spoke to Monday inspected the check, and a different representative I spoke to Friday stated that this was a "" common thing '' that happens, which I found odd because why not place proper protocols for people who are innocent so they won't be at risk?? The money orders were sent to an address in XXXX, TX, which they may not be at anymore. They money orders also have serial numbers to the which I have, AND I sent an email to XXXX card balance right now, as well as forward emails of the listing and the exchanges. I've filed a police report, FTC, Internet crime report, USPS, the whole nine."
5834474,"My name is XXXX XXXX and I am a Truist customer. I have been banking with Suntrust years prior to the merger and I've never faced fraudulent activity of this caliber since the merger of the two firms, Suntrust and BB & T. 

I have been dealing with these issues since XXXX. I am a recent XXXX XXXX looking within the job market. I was under the impression that I was employed remotely with the company XXXX, and I was sent checks for the purchase of office equipment. I sent the first check through XXXX to the "" equipment suppliers '' after doing a mobile deposit and no red flags were raised because Truist cleared this money. I believe the next day I was messaged by someone on XXXX, where I announced my job opportunity, she then alerted me that it may be a scam. These scammers sent her a check as well, but luckily for her, her bank detected that the check was fraudulent and no further action was taken. I had just been sent another check that day, which was also cleared by the bank, but instead of sending it, I let it sit within my account. 

Realizing my predicament, I sat on the phone for hours to speak with a Truist representative to get hung up on twice and then finally be told I need to go into a branch to create a claim. After that, I went to the bank to freeze the account and cancel all credits and deposits coming into the account. The money that was sitting in my account was removed by the clerk and my claim was filed. The next day a police report was filed. 

There was paperwork that needed to be filled out, it needed to be sent back into the claims department within 10 days of them sending it through the mail or your claim would become invalid. I believed this was infeasible, and after 6 days of waiting I was finally able to get a Trusit representative to email the documents because they still had not arrived in the mail. I filled out the paperwork, I added my police report case number and emailed back the documents. The original claims paperwork arrived over two weeks later, way past the 10-day period. I signed all the documents they needed me to sign to authorize the claim to remove liability from me. My claim journey began. 

( **side note : Before moving to Suntrust I was a XXXX client. I was hit with fraudulent activity there because someone got ahold of my bank information. The case was resolved, the account was closed and I was reimbursed for my loss all within the same day of filing that fraudulent claim. *** ) Truist representatives, not all but some, gave attitude to me as I tried to resolve these issues both through their call centers and within the banks. They were not very knowledgeable, every representative had a different explanation for my account and its activity. I was recommended from department to department to review my case. I was told that I would not be held liable for all the overdraft fees and miscellaneous fees that have since appeared on my account since the beginning of the claim. I was told my police report would remove liability from me to be forced to pay the fraudulent check money back. I have also been given the excuse that it takes Truist 5-7 business days before a check is reviewed through mobile deposit which is why the check was cashed. Which in turn, also means that scammers have 5-7 business days to receive the funds before Truist can identify that the activity is fraudulent. Allowing these organizations to cash checks that can not be tracked or traced back to the person the money was sent to. 

My account is now - ( {$2000.00} ) dollars and my claim for reimbursement has been denied because, according to the mail I received, "" The client has not suffered a net loss of funds ''. I've called multiple and different departments about this decision, I was told there was nothing they could do and I was told to report to a branch. I reported to a branch and they told me there is nothing they could do, I need to call the department. I was sent back and forth before finally being told my account is still under investigation, which disregards and invalidates the letter I received. The teller could not hand me any tangible proof that my case was still under investigation. I quote, "" They're trying to get them, the scammers, to send the money back. '' So my question was, "" Will I still be held liable if the scammers dont send the money back? I can guarantee they will not, it's their job as scammers. '' Then the teller shrugged as a response. 

I, again, called multiple departments to file a rebuttal because I was constantly being redirected or told it's a different department that handles rebuttal claims. After two weeks, I was finally able to get the rebuttal filed. Again, I received no tangible paperwork to support the claim through email or mail. By mid-XXXX, Truist sent me a notice saying that the account will be closed and the difference left will be reported to my credit. I called the bank to be told my rebuttal has not been recognized in the system yet. After another two weeks, I reached out again because I had not heard from them. As I predicted, they could not obtain the money their system cleared and sent to the scammers, so my rebuttal was denied. 

As I said earlier, I am a recent XXXX XXXX. I have a XXXX  checking account with Truist. It is not fair of Truist, as a bank, to have a faulty system where their customers lie and remain the main victims. The firm is refusing to take any blame for the activity among customer accounts. They simply released a statement saying that, "" Our customers are our main priority ... '' but show otherwise when their customers need them.

Waiting within the lobby areas of Truist branches to speak with representatives, I learned I was not the only one there disputing a fraudulent charge on an account. Suntrust customers are reporting checks being cashed that 1. ) weren't even endorsed and 2. ) are BB & T checks. These customers have been with Suntrust for 10+ years and never BB & T, yet the bank still allowed these checks to not only be cleared but dispersed. I've researched more and found that since the merger, I am not the only one who has had issues with Truist and their fraud security problem. Small businesses, families and individuals alike have all been negatively affected because scammer organizations realize there is weakness in Truist 's security and these scam organizations are exploiting it. Instead of Truist protecting and helping minimize the damages occured, we, the customers, are being blamed and held liable for the occurence. 

Truist 's customers are the ones who are truly being harmed from their lack of security since this merger. This is not just about mobile deposits, there are cases where people have checks being cashed from outside of the state in which they reside and Truist is clearing them, leaving people with over $ XXXX worth of losses. The bank doesn't reimburse this money to clients, cardholders are expected to pay it back to the bank. 

Truist bank is active on social media platforms in order to speak directly with their clients. Since the fraudulent activity, clients have spilled into their comments throughout different social media platforms expressing their frustrations and anger with Trusit bank. Since then, the bank has cut off their commenting on all their social platforms, they've stopped responding to customer direct messaging through these platforms, and they've also had their representatives on XXXX cut off their messaging ability. The bank is closing off communication from their clients. Call centers and branch visits go nowhere. 

I have filed a complaint with the XXXX  and I am filing a complaint with the Department of Banking and Finance as well as Consumer Finance. We, their customers, are being ignored and forced to pay money to them for their faults. I don't believe that is fair, also considering that prior to the merger, both Suntrust and BB & T were fairly trusted banks. Now, customers are pulling their money from Truist and banking elsewhere before any more damages can be done. A firm that publicly claims to have their customers best interest prioritized yet ignores their customer in their time of need"
5903957,"I have been looking for a job opportunity as I have been unemployed. On XX/XX/2022, I received an email from XXXX of a job opportunity that looked promising. The position looked legitimate from the job description ; I applied on the same day. On XX/XX/2022, I received an invitation for an interview with a XXXX hiring manager and I conducted that interview remotely the same day. I asked for time to review the job offer and ask questions, to which the hiring manager obliged. 

I received the job offer by email on XX/XX/2022 and was able to ask questions via email. They answered appropriately. I thought that I found a good XXXX XXXX position ; but, looking back on it, the job was too good to be true. Between XX/XX/2022 and XX/XX/2022, I was given checks from XXXX ( 1 deposited physically and 4 to mobile deposit into my checking account at Citizens Bank, of whom I have been a loyal customer for over 20 years ) ; and, I was instructed by CardConnect hiring department employees to use these checks for payments toward a work laptop, software, and office set-up. Five of these payments were instructed to be done via XXXX for a total of {$5000.00} sent via XXXX : on XX/XX/2022, {$1000.00} was instructed to be sent ( image attached is associated with this transaction ) ; XX/XX/2022, {$1000.00} was instructed to be sent ; on XX/XX/2022, {$1000.00} was instructed to be sent ; on XX/XX/2022, {$1000.00} was instructed to be sent ; on XX/XX/2022, {$1000.00} was instructed to be sent. 

Unfortunately, on XX/XX/2022, I recognized that my bank gradually returned the deposited XXXX checks. So, effectively, my own funds were used. On XX/XX/2022 and XX/XX/2022, I tried to ask XXXX to reimburse me, but they gave me the run around and not paid me back. Following my late realization, on XX/XX/2022, I filed a report with my local police precinct and submitted a claim about these XXXX transactions with Citizens Bank. My local police precinct deems this entire situation as fraud and is investigating as such ; Citizens Bank should do the same. I also filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission."
5805173,"On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX messaged me on XXXX asking if I wanted money. She didn't tell me what company she worked for, she just said she ran her own business. Being an unemployed, XXXX XXXX XXXX, I needed money to pay for tuition so I said yes. She emailed me a check of {$2500.00} and then asked for me to send {$1000.00} to her grandma to pay for her medical bill. I sent the money and then she asked me to send another {$1000.00} to her doctor. My mom saw the charges and told me it was a scam and I called my bank, USAA, and explained everything that happened. They told me that I would have to pay for the money I sent even though it was a scam."
6504818,"I applied to a job listing on XXXX ( under employer XXXX ) and the employer reached out to me via email, informing me that my resume was selected and that I would need to download the XXXX XXXX  to complete the interview process. Once I completed the interview process, they send me 2 ( fraudulent ) checks for start up materials, one for {$1900.00} and one for {$2900.00}. Once the first check deposited, they had me send {$1700.00} via XXXX bank payments to the vendors to purchase said materials. Once I informed the employer that the second check was on a hold and would be deposited in a week, they told me I shouldve told them and waited, but I should wait for it to deposit to send the money. 2 days later i saw that the first check had been returned as unpaid and the {$1900.00} had been deducted from my account. Once I reached out to the employer informing them the checks returned as unpaid and that I would be taking legal action if this wasnt reprimanded, they simply replied with Okay. and that was the last I ever heard from them. I tried to contact the bank and explain everything that happened, but was told since it was sent via XXXX, that there wasnt anything they could do to recover the funds. So then my account was left NEGATIVE {$1000.00}, while also being unemployed currently."

Inside the message I received a link. http : XXXX I proceeded to fill out paper work and await for response XXXX Received emails stating that I had been employed. First task was to complete the contract agreement and fax it over so that I could officially start work. Also was given a number of the boss XXXX XXXX we were in contact he stated he had been injured and had to work from home and needed an assistant immediately. 
XXXX First task. I received check in mail from employer XXXX. The check was provided so I could pay off an invoice. I deposited the check and was notified it would take a few days to be in the account. The invoice was due that day but the company was notified and allowed a late payment. 
XXXX Made a purchase for a {$100.00} XXXX gift card because the employer thought it would be wise to give a gift because the payment was late. 
XXXX Check cleared into my account. I paid a {$1000.00} XXXX payment to XXXX XXXX for invoice and the second payment went to a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  for {$1500.00}. The {$1500.00} was a cashiers check I got from my bank BB & T which is now considered Truist. I also purchased two more gift cards which where given to Mr. XXXX. I was awaiting my check in the mail on that Friday. 
XXXX Check was returned and no longer in my account. I was alerted that the check was a fraud. Couldnt file claim until the following Monday because operations were closed. Filed claim on the XXXX. 
XXXX Called BB & T to check on claim to find it was denied. Stated I was a victim of fraud but they couldnt do anything because the check was on my account and the money was gone."
6419337,"After applying for work on an online site, I was offered a proofreading position on XX/XX/XXXX and on the next day put into contact with alleged employers of XXXX magazine, represented by a "" XXXX XXXX '' via XXXX who informed me I would be sent funds ( {$2000.00} ) to pay for supplies needed for work which would come as a check in .pdf form. I was instructed by XXXX to use my bank, XXXX 's, mobile deposit feature to deposit the check and further instructed to send 2 {$1000.00} increments to a "" local vender, '' using XXXX to a party identified as XXXX XXXX at XXXX, to acquire the needed supplies ( I did inquire with my bank about depositing the sent check in such a way and they actually advised me how to do it ). 

XXXX seemed to approve the deposit, having the transaction change from "" pending '' to not- '' pending '' the next day ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and even assuring {$500.00} was readily available ; I believed the funds were received and was only able to send one {$1000.00} transaction as there was a {$1500.00} limitation to XXXX XXXX. 

I contacted XXXX to inform her of the limitations and even offered to send an additional {$500.00} as I was eager to receive the needed supplies and starting work. XXXX then became insistent I contact to bank and request they lift the limitation. When I next contacted the bank with this request they informed me this was a known scam and they would suspend the {$2000.00} deposit. At first I was in disbelief as they had apparently approved the {$2000.00} deposit and made me believe it was legit but then said due to me being a "" first level '' customer with no history of bad checks they approved the deposit in full before actually confirming funds were deliverable ; hence, that {$1000.00} XXXX payment came from my own funds. XXXX then informed me they'd hold the deposit ( sending an email that day confirming this ) and dispute the XXXX transaction which had gone through already. They advised me to cease contact with XXXX and send no more money. XXXX, meanwhile, would attempt communication with me throughout the XXXX weekend and a couple of days following, even suggesting sending the rest of the money to a different XXXX account. 

In the time that followed, XXXX continued to send me contradictory communication : on XX/XX/XXXX they sent an email saying {$2000.00} was withdrawn from my account, seemingly indicating they were removing the amount I was erroneously made to believe went through. The next day they sent an email then saying the deposited check didn't go through and was returned. Then on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX then sent an email saying the deposit hold was released and the {$2000.00} deposited in my account. However, that day I then received XXXXwo hard copy items in my mailbox : one was a returned deposited item notice dated XX/XX/XXXX that included a copy of the {$2000.00} check sent to me by XXXX that was described as "" altered/fictitious '', which included wording a fee would be charged to me for it being returned ; the other was a notice dated XX/XX/XXXX saying the {$2000.00} would be available on XX/XX/XXXX, emphasizing "" a portion '' of that deposit would be made available for immediate withdrawal, as per their "" funds availability policy '', which seems a pretty insecure practice to me as it misled me. I later received another hardcopy notice dated XX/XX/XXXX saying the {$1000.00} XXXX transaction would not be refunded, claiming their research confirmed it was applied as I "" instructed '', regardless of my reporting it as a fraud the day they told me the practice was a scam. Not once did they ask for the proof I had on my end showing I was deceived by "" XXXX '' and others seemingly involved in manipulating and inducing me to fall prey to this in the form of screen grabs depicting the communication that was involved. 

In the days that have followed XXXX has frozen my account without informing me, making me delinquent in a credit card payment that has now resulted in my credit card being frozen too. 

I need help and hope the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( Reg. E ) is applicable and can get my money and financial security back, especially at a time when I'm unemployed and have had too much taken from me."
7212558,"I received an email about a job I applied for at XXXX XXXX. The perpetrator pretended to be a part of XXXX XXXX XXXX and initiated a hiring process with me.

They informed me that I was to then send the money to vendors for equipment through XXXX XXXX Venmo. The money "" appeared '' in my account, so I thought it was a legitimate transaction. I sent XXXX before I called the bank. XXXX XXXX XXXX  then informed me they were actually holding the check and it was not available for use. The perpetrator must have known that the money will appear to be in the bank and when to ask for the money. Thinking I had "" gotten the dream job '' I was too blind to actually realize what was going on until it was too late. 
Money was sent on Venmo to the user XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX I called the bank to freeze my accounts and issue new cards. The bank failed to issue new cards immediately. I also filed claims on my behalf. I don't know who this person was, but they are posing as a legitimate company and scamming people with promises of job offers. I never received any equipment, goods, or services which is what I thought I was being paid for. Venmo has told me that I received no protection under these circumstances and there is nothing they can do because they provided the service they are employed to do. I tried to inform Venmo that I do not authorize any transactions, but they performed those transactions regardless. They are protecting the thief under a privacy protection plan. 

Additionally, I had an expired card on file when I attempted to send money. The transaction didn't go through because the card was no longer in service. The money was sent on a second attempt from a separate card. Now Venmo is attempting to charge me {$2000.00}. Meanwhile, I haven't authorized either of these transactions"
4035380,"I have been a victim of a scam. I am unemployed and seeking work. I built a resume on XXXX XXXX and a company reached out for a virtual job interview. I accepted. The interview was at XXXX XX/XX/2020 and went til XXXX. I accepted the job offer and the company sent me an employee letter and XXXX to fill out. They sent a check over night for me to deposit and this would be used as my start up equipment. I was to begin training immediately after receiving my equipment. The check was deposited on XX/XX/XXXX. I was required to pay, using the funds once the check was cleared, to a trusted vendor that would send me all the programs needed already downloaded on the laptop. My bank has said theres nothing they can do once I started to suspect anything and XXXX has only sent an email saying they are not responsible. Hours after this happened while I was on hold with my bank for 1 hour I was losing access to mobile banking. Since I am unemployed and have only the government funds I receive for unemployment I now am required to use that money to live off of and start making payments to my bank for the transaction. I am upset because I disputed these transactions and us bank ran an investigation which no one contacted me to inquire about this and they do not have all the details so how did they complete the investigation? XXXX needs to take out their main add that they are backed by big banks so its safer than XXXX. And the banks need to help us as our financial institution. The scammers are getting too good for everyone to know how to handle these situations. Disappointed in everyone involved with this."
4239683,"Description sent to the FBI and FTC I am currently unemployed and applied for a job using XXXX on XXXX. It was XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX position at a XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). On XXXX I received an email response and was invited for an interview via XXXX with XXXX XXXX. She offered me the job, sent me paperwork to sign, and said they would be purchasing a computer and equipment for me to use. They sent a XXXX  check for the equipment in the amount of {$4800.00}. The checked looked very professional so I deposited it. I've been out of work for soo long and was very excited to get started. They said the check would take 2-3 days to clear, so I offered to use my money to pay the local vendor while their check clears. I went to the bank, got a cashiers check and used it to transfer {$4500.00} to the account they said was their local vendor, who would put everything together and would deliver. The vendor Mr XXXX XXXX texted me and asked to verify my address for the delivery. Meanwhile they asked for a picture of my driver 's license for a background check and had me email it to XXXX When I started getting suspicious I found out the address on their check is the same address for a liquor store in Illinois. I asked XXXX to respond to a XXXX connect/message to verify her authenticity, XXXX XXXX repeatedly assured me that she would, but I never received a response from the real XXXX XXXX on XXXX. Before the interview, I looked up the XXXX Job description but the page was not there. I thought the employer simply stopped taking new applicants. XXXX took down the page and left no warning for me or others. Chase bank lifted the hold on the deposited check and rejected the transfer due to the account being closed. They would not reverse the {$4500.00} transfer either. Furthermore I received a call on XXXX from a real estate agent XXXX of XXXX Georgia asking for a XXXX who had registered my phone number on a XXXX ad. It's a very odd coincidence, hopefully nothing but I am now afraid someone is using my identity. 

The reason I am reporting this to the FBI is that it involves more than one state. I live in California, the check 's address is in Illinois, XXXX is in XXXX Virginia, XXXX is in XXXX XXXX or at least that's where their phones originate from. The communication was through email, XXXX, and text messages from 2 phone numbers ( XXXX XXXX Virginia XXXX ) and ( XXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). 

Please Note the XXXX account is still active and I am still getting responses. It is possible to trace a XXXX IP address using a XXXX machine and running a trace route using XXXX command prompt. All I would need to do is allow you access to my XXXX account and you could find this person 's IP address.

8714085,"I was the victim of a work scam. I answered an e-mail sent out through the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX e-mail, regarding working from home for a professor related to the XXXX program. I answered and accepted the position. On XX/XX/2024, after supposedly being employed and completing an assignment I was given, I received a check for {$1600.00} from my "" employer ''. I used mobile deposit to deposit the check into my XXXX savings account and received a confirmation of the transaction from the bank and the funds seemed to be available on XXXX. On the following day, XX/XX/2024 my "" employer '' requested that I transfer {$1000.00} of the funds to another employee so that the other employee could use the funds to make a purchase for the department. I attempted to transfer the funds to this other person first on XXXX and then on XXXX and both times the transactions were declined. My employer asked me to then try Zelle. ( I had been following their instructions on what to do ). The transfer of {$1000.00} from my account to the other employee seemed to go through using Zelle. The situation seemed odd to me so I reached out to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  department on XX/XX/2024 ( ticket # XXXX ). Later, that same day the IT department called me and told me that the XXXX e-mail used to communicate with the so called employer/professor was fraudulent. I immediately contacted the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX police department and subsequently the XXXX XXXX XXXX Police department ( report # XXXX ). On the same day, XXXX I also contacted my bank, XXXX, to inform them of the situation. The bank immediately "" froze '' my accounts both checking and savings. On XX/XX/2024, the XXXXXXXX XXXX department recommended that I file a report on IC3.gov, internal crime complaint center, which I did. On XX/XX/2024, I was contacted by XXXX and was told that I owed the bank the {$1000.00} that was sent out through Zelle. XXXX said it was my responsibility as the originally deposited check eventually bounced and the funds were not there. I feel like I am being punished twice as a victim and the bank is seemingly free of responsibility for the situation. The "" virtual funds '' were transferred multiple times before XXXX determined the check was fraudulent. If XXXX had verified the check sooner or even put a hold on the funds related to the unusual activity the {$1000.00} would not have been released. Zelle could have declined the transaction themselves just as XXXX and XXXX did. If Zelle had done this, the money would never have gone anywhere. I would never have requested the transaction if I knew I didn't have the funds to cover the transaction. I truly feel like the bank, XXXX, and Zelle should share some of the responsibility for the victimization of the consumer by fraud. All of us were taken advantage of. Now a XXXX XXXX who is already short on funds and who was willing to take a job to earn some extra money, is expected to pay back what I don't even have."
1617882,"while looking for employment I was approached via email XXXX for a XXXX XXXX Position. HR contacted me and passed this initial interview. I was then passed on to the HR trainer where 4 weeks of training would be conducted on line. XXXX 2 weeks I was learning policies, acronyms, processes, etc. and passing weekly tests. The XXXX week i was asked to purchased some equipment ( valued at {$7400.00} XXXX and send out of country to a new office being opened. Being careful throughout this whole process about identity theft, I provided no personal info, in fact the hiring company said a few times that no personal info was required untill I passed the 4 weeks of training and met the hiring manager for the final interview. So for the XXXX project I was issued XXXX that had an account # and routing # XXXX CHASE BANK XXXX with funds that were put into my name that were to be used to purchase the equipment. I was asked to use my personal CC at this time till I became full time employed. I transfered the funds from the account info provided into my personal CC and waited till the funds posted. Once posted a few days later I proceeded to purchase the requested equipment and ship out of country to the designated address. I was requested to use USPS priority international delivery. I was then asked to perform the exact same task a second time which is when I suspected something was n't right and asked a few more questions. At this time the response from XXXX XXXX was not acceptable and knew at this time something was wrong. I sent a final email declining the XXXX project / /purchase and also declined any employement with the company., I then proceeded to stop the shipment that was done earlier that morning with the USPS and was told that I was not able to stop it being it is an international shipment. I then contacted my credit card company "" CHASE '' and explained the situation and was told the funds are OK and no issues. I have been checking my account daily to ensure no issues and on XXXX/XXXX/15, the posted amount of {$8000.00} was reversed from my credit card account. I do not understand how CHASE bank that the funds were transfered from did not know the account I was using to transfer funds does not have a check / balance process in place to review and detect scams like this. A phone call or text or something to the actual owner of the account. Besides the names being different on the accounts. Todays day and age with technology, banks should be able to detect scams like this."
