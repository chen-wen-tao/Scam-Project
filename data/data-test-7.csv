11310670,"I was contacted by a company claiming to be XXXX, which presented itself as a legitimate employer offering remote work. The job involved completing sets and reviewing albums and singles. I performed the tasks requested and communicated with the alleged representatives of XXXX throughout the process. 
After completing the work, I expected compensation as agreed, but I was never paid. When I reached out to the actual owner of XXXX to address the issue, they informed me that their company was being impersonated and had no involvement in the job offer or the tasks I completed. 
During this process, I was scammed out of a significant amount of moneyapproximately {$13000.00}. These funds were transferred through transactions that I now understand were part of the scam, as the fraudulent individuals convinced me to send money under false pretenses. 
I reported the fraud to my bank, Santander, and provided all the evidence I had, including communication with the scammers, details of the transactions, and proof of the alleged job tasks I completed. Despite this, my claim was denied due to "" inconsistencies. '' However, I do not understand what inconsistencies the bank found, as I believe my documentation clearly demonstrates that I was scammed. 
This situation has caused me significant financial hardship, and I am seeking further clarity on why my claim was denied and what additional steps I can take to recover my lost funds. I have also reported this incident to law enforcement and would like assistance in resolving this matter."
11258229,"I was offered a remote job by someone acting like a big HR person from a known company. They provided me with documentation that was exactly like the real company ( Assurant ) everything matched up and even did my due diligence with verifying linked accounts. They provided me with a check and insisted i deposit because of the nature of work environment and the holidays. I called my bank XXXX and asked them about the check and that i felt something was wrong. XXXX advised me to deposit it so they could look at it however, the fraudulent person was extremely pushy for me to transfer funds to a fake vendor to get my remote equipment. I ended up sending {$5000.00} as instructed and once my bank alerted me i immediately went to Paypal for help and they said nothing could be done. So i reported everything to government agencies such as, FBI IC3, FTC and DFPI. I have all records, messages, documentation, voice recordings to show proof of the entire scam. Paypal said they could not do anything for me so i created a case in PayPal and i need help fighting it. I just want someone to help step in and stop this scammer from scamming other American people like myself looking for work in this economy. please help!"
11629506,"An email appeared in my college email and it was an summer internship offering. I replied to the email so I can apply and work to help pay off my student bills. We only emailed each other and there weren't any like interviews to be held but I just didn't think much about it. The person I responded the email to told me that a person who was in charge of the materials was going to message me and he would tell me what to get. In a hour, I get a message from the person that the guy emailed me about and the person introduced themself and start with listing the materials I needed. He/She also mentioned that they would send checks through email and that I would have to deposit the money and buy the stuff myself. But the thing is, when I deposit the checks, the bank institution that I use says it will take a couple of days until the checks go through. I told them about it and he/she says that they couldn't wait since it would delay their schedule time. So they insisted that I would have to send them money from my savings and then they would buy it for me. We proceeded with that option and it kept going throughout the month and one day I woke up and got an email saying my account has a low balance. I checked and I lost everything. All my savings, all the money from the checks and I was in the negative numbers in my balance. I called the bank and they told me that the checks I deposited were fake and I texted the guy and he never responded back when I told him/her that the checks were fake. I called the bank institution to report about the fraud incident, reported it to XXXX  and the sheriff. They all came back with nothing and I had no reimbursements."
11338911,"I got a XXXX email in my XXXX account for an XXXX XXXX  over the summer and I replied to the email so that I could get the role. They asked for my achievements and past activities to see if I had any experience and XXXX days later I was told that another person would text me and proceed with the payments for the materials for my internship. They sent me digital checks and I would deposit it through Bank of America and due to the deposit wait, it would take a week for the check to process through my account. Because the wait time was long and the schedule didn't align with them, I had to pay out of pocket. I XXXX them the amount of money they requested and in return, they sent me a digital check of the amount I XXXX them as a "" reimbursement ''. This lasted for a couple weeks and then XXXX day I got an email saying that my balance was too low. Once I checked, it showed that I lost all my savings and everything. I started panicking and tried contacting the guy who offered the XXXX and he never responded. I soon realized it was a scam and the checks were fake. I called the sheriff 's department and my bank to report a fraud case. The sheriff said he would investigate but he never got back to me after a few days of reporting. I even called XXXX and Bank of America and they told me they would investigate but they said they couldn't pay me back in a few days. I was completely devastated that I lost all my money."
11582419,"About a year and a half ago I was scammed out of a little over {$1000.00} through Zelle due to a job scam. I was avidly trying to get a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and these people fronting as a company sent fake checks in order to purchase the equipment for me to work. If ZelleXXXX  XXXX XXXX had the proper safeguards at the time it could have been caught early or even prevented. XXXX did eventually catch on to the fraud, but by that point I was scammed out of over {$1000.00}. They ended up putting me on a payment plan and claimed they see this scam all the time, but had no safety features in place yet ( which seems like an oversight )."
11913356,"I was approached for my XXXX XXXX XXXX  from an individual who claimed to work for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. My role was to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
I was provided a check in advance for my services for {$5000.00}. After cashing this check, a couples days later the project slowly began to be canceled in phases, with the school requiring me to send money back in waves. After first sending them {$2500.00} digitally, the next day the {$5000.00} check had reversed itself due to being fake. The individual ( XXXX ) continued to request more stating, but once I pushed back stating their check was invalid and they owed me {$2500.00}, they went dark and I lost contact. 
I filed a claim with my bank, Capital One, who ultimately denied. The bank encouraged me to send documented proof prior to this decision, which I did. I requested information on how they made their decision to deny me, and it turns out they never used the information I had sent them and simply made this decision off our brief phone call when I first filed the claim. 
Below I am providing a step by step timeline of interactions with a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX in California seeking my services as an XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX XXXX provided a budget of {$5000.00}. I suggested that only half be sent as a deposit, but XXXX XXXX insisted on paying in full by sending a certified cashier 's Check. 

XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX XXXX requests my name, address, bank, and phone number for check distribution. Several days follow and I have to follow up for the check to be sent. 

XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX XXXX and I continue to communicate back and forth as I begin the illustration project and provide first drafts. XXXX provides feedback on multiple occasions through text and email. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Check is delivered ( attached document for reference ). XXXX XXXX texts me immediately upon its delivery to inform me that the check has arrived and that I should cash it digitally as soon as possible. I do so. He states that the {$5000.00} dollar check has been deposited successfully and deducted from their account the moment I cashed it. My account was pending at this time. 

XXXX starts to inform me that the project is changing and less work XXXX be involved. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Receive email and texts from XXXX XXXX stating that half the project ( Phase XXXX ) is canceled. He requests an immediate return of {$2500.00} as soon as possible. My Capital One account currently says the majority of the {$5000.00} check funds are in my account as the remainder was still processing. XXXX provides a document supposedly from the school stating the projects Phase XXXX cancellation ( attached document for reference ). 

XXXX texts me saying that I should send a XXXX payment to the email of XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). He also requests screenshot receipts of this transaction. I send the {$2500.00} and provide documentation. 

XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX XXXX texts and calls me first thing in the morning stating that the project is canceled in its entirety, and that I should immediately XXXX an additional {$1500.00} to XXXX XXXX at XXXX. I received a second document that morning from XXXX confirming the entire projects cancellation, apparently signed off by XXXX XXXX of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

A check reversal of the {$5000.00} check had taken place automatically earlier that morning, and {$5000.00} was removed from my bank account sending me into the negative. Most likely due to being a fraudulent check. At this point, I have also already paid them back {$2500.00} of my own actual mone. 

I call my bank, Capital One immediately and begin to file a claim for a scam/fraud. They inform me that they received the {$2500.00} and it had been successfully deposited into their account, which also happened to be a Capital One account. 

XXXX continues to text for immediate updates and keeps stating that the {$2500.00} I sent prior did not process. At this point, I inform him that there is no money left in my account, and that their check to was reversed and I am owed {$2500.00}. 

XXXX slowly starts to stop communicating with light contact, but never fully responds to my concerns. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I follow up XXXX more time in the morning requesting the return of my {$2500.00} ( claim amount ) along with {$1000.00} owed to me for compensation. No response. XXXX XXXX officially goes dark and I never hear from him again. 

Capital One stated that I could provide any proof and documentation to help support my claim after my first initial call on XX/XX/XXXX. I provide Capital One with all text messages, emails, documents and fraudulent check via email. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Capital Ones responds stating that my claim is denied. I request documentation regarding how they made this decision, as stated as an option in their email. 2-5 days required for processing. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Capital One provides documentation regarding their decision to deny my claim. The email showed that they did not review the proof that I sent them and made their decision solely on my first phone call reporting the scam which does not go into enough detail based on their questioning. 

XX/XX/XXXX : After discovering that Capital One did not utilize the information that I provided them for their own internal investigation, I proceeded to call XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX personally to look into the matter. XXXX suggested that I email their HR team explaining the situation. As of XX/XX/XXXX, I have yet to hear back any information."
