11/13/25,1,scam_other,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","Money order, traveler's check or cashier's check",Fraud or scam,None,"I am filing this complaint regarding Wells Fargo 's mishandling of a fraud case involving my account. Despite promptly reporting the fraudulent activity and providing all requested documentation, the bank has failed to take appropriate action to protect my funds and resolve the issue in a timely and transparent manner. 

On XX/XX/year>, I was contacted by what appeared to be the banks fraud department regarding suspicious activity on my account. The communication mirrored legitimate messages Ive previously received from the bank, including the same wording and format. Ultimately, I was scammed into depositing a cashier 's check for {$30000.00} to a fraudulent account. I immediately contacted Wells Fargo as soon as I realized it was a scam, which was merely XXXX hours after the fraudulent transaction was made. 

During that call, I informed the bank that a {$30000.00} cashiers check had been deposited into what I later discovered to be a fraudulent account. The representative confirmed that the receiving account was also with Wells Fargo and stated that the transaction was still pending. However, instead of stopping or reversing the transaction while it was pendingas I requestedthe representative advised that there was nothing they could do at that time but she said she would "" flag '' the check as fraudulent. I was then advised to call Wells Fargo 's Loss Prevention Department or visit a local bank to stop the payment. 

At the local bank, I was informed by a banker that the funds unfortunately processed but upon looking into the suspect 's account, he can see that {$27000.00} of my funds are still remaining. However, they are unable to retrieve the funds since I authorized the transfer. He told me that these types of scams are happening more and that it's basically a "" legal loophole ''. His advise is to just take the loss since the scammers could be anybody and might not even be in this country. I asked if they would at least investigate the fraudulent account and who I need to contact to request this. The banker 's response is that the investigation will be launched automatically by the fraud department since Wells Fargo had to close my compromised accounts. I was told to expect them to reach out for additional details and in the meantime, they will be placing a hold on the suspect 's account to review its legitimacy. 

The following morning, I contacted Wells Fargo for an update on the investigation that was promised. The agent and her supervisor both confirmed that the case was closed and that no investigation was conducted since I authorized the payment. I pleaded to have my case investigated given the large amount that was taken and the fact that there is an account with Wells Fargo conducting fraudulent activities. Their response was quite dismissive and lacked any urgency. To date, the bank has failed to provide a clear written explanation or any meaningful resolution. 

This situation has caused me significant financial and emotional distress. I believe the bank failed to take prompt action to prevent loss when notified of the fraudulent activity, properly investigate and communicate the status of my claim, and adhere to reasonable standards of care in protecting consumers from fraudulent activity within their own banking network.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,CA,958XX,None,Consent provided,Web,11/13/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,17224078

On XX/XX/year>, I sent a wire from Zions Bank in XXXX, UT, to an account at XXXX XXXX XXXX  for a tractor purchase. I verified the sellers website with the branch XXXX before sending the funds, because I did not know the recipient personally. 

When I discovered the transaction was fraudulent, I contacted Zions Bank by phone on XX/XX/XXXX and was told to come into the branch the next business day ( XX/XX/XXXX ). The branch initiated a wire recall and sent a Hold Harmless Agreement to XXXX XXXX. I followed every instruction given. 

However, I later learned from XXXX XXXX  not Zions that there is a reimbursement process that must be filed through the originating bank ( Zions ). Zions Bank never disclosed this process, never initiated it, and has ignored all my follow-up communications since. I have sent multiple emails to Zions Banks Office of the President, but have received no substantive response beyond a single acknowledgment of receipt. 

Zions Banks failure to communicate, to inform me of the reimbursement procedure, and to timely respond to repeated outreach constitutes a serious lack of transparency and due care.

11/14/25,1,scam_other,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Fraud or scam,None,"This complaint concerns a fraudulent domestic wire transfer of USD XXXX from my Citibank checking account ending in XXXX, on XX/XX/year>, reported under case number XXXX. The transaction was unauthorized ; I neither initiated nor approved it. Upon receiving the alert of the transaction at XXXX PM XXXX, I acted immediately and contacted Citibanks fraud line. After several failed attempts navigating the automated system, I reached a live agent at XXXX PM XXXX, only XXXX minutes after being notified of the unauthorized transfer.- During a XXXX call, I clearly reported that the transfer was fraudulent and requested both the cancellation of the transaction and the immediate blocking of my account. The agent confirmed that the funds had already left my account and were sent to another bank but assured me that Citibank would request a recall from the receiving bank, block further transfers, and secure my account. The agent also stated that the incident would be recorded as fraud and that an investigation would be opened. At the end of the call, the agent attempted to transfer me to the fraud department for additional verification. After more than XXXX minutes on hold, the call disconnected. I immediately tried calling XXXX more times that evening, without success.- On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX contacted me. They indicated they were already aware of the case and only needed to confirm routine questions ( for example, whether I had shared my credentials or been coerced to make the transfer ). After answering, I informed the agent that I still had full access to my online banking, which surprised him, and he then proceeded to block the account at that momentalmost XXXX hours after I had first reported the fraud. This delay represents a significant security failure.- Despite my prompt and good-faith actions, Citibank did not stop XXXX reverse the transaction. Internal records show that the transfer was posted on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX days after my report, which demonstrates that there was still time to intervene if the bank had acted diligently.- Weeks later, I received Citibanks denial letter dated XX/XX/year> ( received XX/XX/XXXX at my residence ). The letter stated that the payment order was accepted as your authenticated request, without providing any evidence, explanation, or documentation of the investigation. This response ignores the key facts that I reported the fraud within XXXX minutes of the alert, that Citibank acknowledged my request to stop the transfer, and that their systems failed to secure my account.- Inconsistent internal practices further highlight procedural flaws. For smaller, legitimate transfers that I personally initiated in the past, Citibank often delayed or held the transaction pending verification. Yet this high-value transfer of nearly USD XXXX was processed instantly, without additional checks or confirmation. This inconsistency shows a failure of Citibanks fraud prevention systems and procedures.- The banks reasoningthat the use of correct credentials equals authorizationis legally and factually incorrect. Under Regulation E of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ), banks must perform a reasonable and good-faith investigation into unauthorized transfers and limit consumer liability when the customer reports promptly, as I did. Even if Citibank attempts to treat this as a wire transfer under UCC Article 4A, that law requires the banks security procedures to be commercially reasonable and applied in good faith. Approving a large, atypical transaction without additional verification when smaller transfers were subject to checks does not meet that standard.- The investigation and response show serious deficiencies : ( XXXX ) The bank did not provide authentication or access logs, IP data, device fingerprints, or SMS validation records. 
( XXXX ) It did not clarify whether any recall requests, Suspicious Activity Reports ( XXXX ), or XXXX notifications were issued ; ( XXXX ) It failed to explain the three-day gap between the date I reported the fraud ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and the date the transaction was posted ( XX/XX/XXXX ), during which recovery was still possible ; ( XXXX ) It closed the investigation without addressing these key elements or providing transparency.- The evidence clearly shows that Citibank failed to : XXXX XXXX ) Provide accessible and effective fraud reporting channels ; ( XXXX ) Act immediately upon notification to stop or recall the transfer ; ( XXXX ) Block the account in a timely manner ; ( XXXX ) Conduct a transparent and adequate investigation in compliance with Regulation E and UCC Article 4A ; XXXX XXXX ) Provide documentation to support its denial.- Citibanks conclusion that the transaction was authenticated does not constitute proof of authorization. It disregards the facts, timing, and procedural obligations. The case was closed superficially, without a proper review or regulatory compliance.- Given these circumstances, I am filing this complaint to request CFPB oversight and a formal review of Citibanks handling of this matter. The banks actions ( and inaction ) show a lack of diligence, internal control, and compliance with XXXX consumer protection law. I am opening a new complaint because Citibanks prior response did not address the substantive deficiencies outlined above, failed to provide any of the requested documentation, and did not resolve the issues surrounding its investigation. The unresolved procedural failures, unanswered questions, and lack of transparency justify reopening the matter under a new CFPB case, as the original investigation remains incomplete and non-compliant with regulatory standards.-",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",None,XXXXX,None,Consent provided,Web,11/14/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,17260065

I stated that none of these alleged charges were mine. They then asked if I had authorized a {$1000.00} payment to someone ( I can't recall the name they said ) via XXXX. I said no. They said ok, let 's go ahead and start the process to refund your money. 

They had me enter a phone number ( XXXX ) for the refund to start processing. The enrolled phone number came up via XXXX as XXXX. 

Once the money was "" sent '' to be refunded I noticed that I was negative {$1000.00}. I immediately hung up. I submitted a dispute that evening and called in a dispute the next day. 

I received notice that the dispute was concluded and that there was no error so the payment to this fraudulent/scam "" person '' would stand. 

I expressed my frustration and they suggested I call XXXX. I contacted XXXX and they told me to re-contact my bank because they could possibly do something more- basically passing the buck. 

XXXX transferred me to USAA and USAA stated there was really nothing to do other than re-open the dispute, which we did. 

I feel I am reasonably smart, but was still taken by this scam. I am extremely frustrated that top companies like USAA and XXXX do not have further protections in place since they deal with money.

In XXXX XXXX, I was the victim of an international fraud scheme carried out by XXXX criminals impersonating XXXX authorities.

They were smug and indifferent, unwilling to issue me a reference number or contact to follow up with for status check on the "" investigation.

11/11/25,1,scam_other,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Fraud or scam,None,"On XX/XX/year>, I initiated a wire transfer of {$24000.00} from my XXXX XX/XX/XXXXchecking account to what I believed was a legitimate auto dealership account at Wells Fargo Bank. The transaction later turned out to involve a fraudulent recipient account. 

Immediately after receiving the funds, the recipient withdrew or transferred all funds and closed the Wells Fargo account. XXXX has been actively attempting to recover the funds and obtain cooperation from Wells Fargo since XX/XX/year>, but Wells Fargo has not responded or provided any documentation or restitution. 

Concerns : Wells Fargo appears to have failed to perform proper Know Your Customer ( KYC ) and Anti-Money-Laundering ( XXXX ) due-diligence checks under the Bank Secrecy Act ( BSA ).

The bank may have violated UCC Article 4A-204 by accepting and disbursing funds into a fraudulent or unauthorized account.

The rapid withdrawal and account closure should have triggered a Suspicious Activity Report ( SAR ). If a SAR was filed, Wells Fargo took no remedial action or provided any follow-up response to XXXX or me. 
The absence of communication or cooperation from Wells Fargo has prolonged the loss and caused ongoing financial hardship, including difficulty maintaining mortgage obligations and other credit payments. 

Requested CFPB Action : XXXX. Require Wells Fargo to provide documentation regarding the recipient account, including XXXX and transaction history. 
XXXX. Confirm whether Wells Fargo complied with XXXX and XXXX reporting obligations. 
XXXX. XXXX Wells Fargo to coordinate with XXXX Bank to refund or restore the misdirected funds. 
XXXX Review this case in light of the consumer harm and financial stress caused by Wells Fargos failure to act.

I am requesting that Wells Fargo Bank provide a full explanation and documentation of their actions regarding the fraudulent recipient account, confirm compliance with XXXX and XXXX obligations XXXX and coordinate restitution of the {$24000.00} wire transfer with XXXX XX/XX/XXXXXXXX 

I am able to provide a call log, case numbers and dates of the XXXX times I have contacted XXXX XX/XX/XXXXto follow up with this case, along with emails and purchase agreement between the auto dealership and myself along with the online listing of the vehicle upon request. I am also able to obtain the police report I filed with my local jurisdiction if needed.
