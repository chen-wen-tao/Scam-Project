1306236,"I am currently unemployed, so I am looking for work. I received an email about a XXXX XXXX position on XXXX/XXXX/XX/XX/2015. I requested more information and and received additional details and some paperwork to complete from XXXXXXXXXXXX. After I performed some research on the company and not finding anything negative, I completed their paperwork on XXXX/XXXX/XX/XX/2015 and awaited further instructions. On XXXX/XXXX/XX/XX/2015, I received an email advising that I had been chosen as a XXXX XXXX. I next started to receive calls from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who started the training process of me initially processing checks for their customers as well as funding loans. I was also contacted from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. They wired funds to my account on XXXX/XXXX/XX/XX/2015 and XXXX XXXX to Money Gram this to XXXX of their customers. This was done today XXXX/XXXX/XX/XX/2015 and the Money Gram reference # XXXX. Shortly after the funds were sent, they reversed the initial funds from to my account. The amount of my loss is {$990.00}. Please let me know if you need additional details or if you have questions. This company is still in operation doing business as usual. I would like to see them taken down as they stole my hard earned money and are still using the same website, phone numbers and email addresses. I would like to help out as best I can."
1617882,"while looking for employment I was approached via email XXXX for a XXXX XXXX Position. HR contacted me and passed this initial interview. I was then passed on to the HR trainer where 4 weeks of training would be conducted on line. XXXX 2 weeks I was learning policies, acronyms, processes, etc. and passing weekly tests. The XXXX week i was asked to purchased some equipment ( valued at {$7400.00} XXXX and send out of country to a new office being opened. Being careful throughout this whole process about identity theft, I provided no personal info, in fact the hiring company said a few times that no personal info was required untill I passed the 4 weeks of training and met the hiring manager for the final interview. So for the XXXX project I was issued XXXX that had an account # and routing # XXXX CHASE BANK XXXX with funds that were put into my name that were to be used to purchase the equipment. I was asked to use my personal CC at this time till I became full time employed. I transfered the funds from the account info provided into my personal CC and waited till the funds posted. Once posted a few days later I proceeded to purchase the requested equipment and ship out of country to the designated address. I was requested to use USPS priority international delivery. I was then asked to perform the exact same task a second time which is when I suspected something was n't right and asked a few more questions. At this time the response from XXXX XXXX was not acceptable and knew at this time something was wrong. I sent a final email declining the XXXX project / /purchase and also declined any employement with the company., I then proceeded to stop the shipment that was done earlier that morning with the USPS and was told that I was not able to stop it being it is an international shipment. I then contacted my credit card company "" CHASE '' and explained the situation and was told the funds are OK and no issues. I have been checking my account daily to ensure no issues and on XXXX/XXXX/15, the posted amount of {$8000.00} was reversed from my credit card account. I do not understand how CHASE bank that the funds were transfered from did not know the account I was using to transfer funds does not have a check / balance process in place to review and detect scams like this. A phone call or text or something to the actual owner of the account. Besides the names being different on the accounts. Todays day and age with technology, banks should be able to detect scams like this."
2060433,See attached files. BB & T granted immediate online approval of a 3rd party check for deposit into our personal account via BB & T online banking app ( where they admit technical flaws ). My wife was victim of an articulate online job scam. BB & T approved the check immediately and my wife XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX took {$870.00} cash out next day to deposit in 3rd party account with XXXX XXXX Bank ( who has now frozen that fraudulent account and funds ). 3 days later ... BB & T notified us our account was drastically overdrawn b/c the check was a scam ( they told us 3 days later! ) and are now trying to hold us responsible for the bad XXXX XXXX check that should have been verified/checked by BB & T immediately. They still have not returned our missing {$190.00} from my account and are trying to hold my family responsible for the negative balance of - {$780.00}. I 've requested details and meetings with BB & T fraud and VP to no avail. Contact XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX at XXXX.
2105037,"On XXXX of 2016 my girlfriend accepted a job. Little to our knowledge it was a job scam. The job provided contracts, websites, accreditation, and business registration number. She was told her job was an XXXX. She was told a client was sending money to our account. She was told to open a XXXX XXXX XXXX account. She was told after thirty days they would put her on the company account but until then she had to use her own. The client wired XXXX into our account. The bank approved it and allowed her to move the money. Domestic wire transfers are reviewed and posted the same day. It took a week for them to decide to reject the wire transfer. They froze the account with NO NOTICE. They would n't tell me anything but that my account was under review and to call in three business days. I could n't access my money. I am in the XXXX in three months. I was treated awful by the bank they did n't work with me at all. They accused me of fraud. They should have froze the account the day the wire transfer went in and investigated it then. They should have flagged it. My girlfriend was scammed and we have to pay for it? What kind of protection is that? The fraud department at USAA does n't even have contact information. They said we could n't talk to anyone about the investigation. It was n't until the bank froze the account we found out the job was a scam. We wish we would have known the day the transfer happened. This job spent three weeks convincing and "" training '' my girlfriend. She had no idea it was a scam and she even XXXX and asked for verifications. The bank let us down by not protecting us. We make average money the bank has never seen huge amounts hit out account they should have called and asked about it. They should have investigated it. Within a week of freezing the account all they said was the name was spelled wrong. They were accusing US of first party fraud? And they were exercising their right to do business with us ... not to mention informing us the bank took a "" hit '' by approving the funds they did n't review so we had to pay it back."
2105053,"I fell victim to a job scam for a XXXX that was starting business in America but is headquarter in XXXX ( they went the extra mile to prove legitimacy ) I was told by employer that client was sending me funds that I needed to open a business account at XXXX XXXX XXXX ( they apparently bank there and they said it was cheaper fees ). The wire transfer was sent from client to my bank account via wire transfer ... the bank approved the funds. I did the job. The client attempted to send me another wire transfer. I became uncomfortable with this because it went to my personal account with USAA and not the account they told me to set up. When I tried to send the money my account was froze. All I was told was that it would be three days and my account went to the fraud department ... no details. I talked to my employer who said he would send proof of legitimacy.I sent documents given by employer. When I was accused of fraud because the client spelled his name wrong my employer said he would contact an attorney and get back to me ... well needless to say I never got paid and he never called back. I discover I was part of a job scam. I call the bank to see what they said. They accused me of first party fraud because the client spelled his name wrong when he sent the first transfer. The bank took A WEEK to reject the XXXX wire transfer. I fell victim to a job scam. I know this now. Sadly the bank is keeping my fiance 's XXXX hard earned dollars and we were told we owe almost XXXX dollars! The bank has treated me horribly. They offered no help. I have filed with the state attorney general, the fbi Internet crimes department and the FTC. A domestic wire transfer should n't take a week to reject. USAA should have contacted me way before then, they said that they approved the funds so now we are stuck with the bill. They approved the funds in a few minutes, they should have called and questioned me and help me keep from falling for this. I fell for the scam because everything checked out there were details, numbers contracts and proof of registration as a business. I did n't know anything about job scams until now ... USAA knows who sent me the fraudulent wire transfer. I have the information and bank account numbers of where the money went. Instead of ordering me to repay what the bank was scammed out of why cant they go after the people who tricked me? USAA has hardly told me anything. They only accused me of fraud said they were exercising their rights to not do business with me or my fianc and said they were closing our account and we owe almost XXXX. I do n't feel like I was protected under fraud protection. They did n't provide any information once they froze the account they did n't ask questions to try to keep this from happening. To make matters worse they treated me wrong. When my fianc called they made it seem like we dilibertly caused this. If an investigation is opened to prevent fraud they should at least call and ask questions. Also when we called or messaged they would n't answer our questions. Why does n't the fraud department have a number to call and talk to someone? The day the wire transfer sent if they would have froze the account then and investigated it they could have found the error and rejected it. We spent a week with no money. Our bills are late and we lost our money. USAA did n't protect their customers. They set us up. It even says wire transfers are REVIEWED THE SAME DAY! This one was n't reviewed the same day."
2317878,"I deposited a check from a fraudulent company/ job scam and deposited the check into Bank of America and withdrew the funds after they did n't initially stop the check. Some time after withdrawing the funds, they put the check on hold, causing me to show and overbalance and they are not cooperating with me at all in order to resolve. I understand that they can not directly go after the company, but at the rate I 'm going, I 'm going to be slapped with overdraft fees when they essentially told me to go get the money myself."
2318180,"On Thursday XXXX/XXXX/17, I deposited {$8600.00} into a Wells Fargo account for a job, not knowing that it was all a part of a job scam involving fraudulent transactions and counterfeit checks. On Saturday XXXX/XXXX/17, I visited the same bank where I made a deposit, informed a banker of my situation, opened a new checkings account and had my banker file a claim in order to retrieve the funds. After all this, the account where the funds were sent was blocked and Wells Fargo would begin conducting an investigation which would lead to the {$8600.00} being transferred into the new checkings account so that the overbalance in another account would be resolved. On Monday, I wished to learn about the status of the investigation and after being transferred from department to department for about two hours, the representative I talked to was n't able to find my open claim and I had to start a new claim, even though representatives from previous calls that same day could see my open claim. I would like for Wells Fargo to keep me informed about the status of my claim so that I can have these issues resolved in a timely manner and not be forced to wait longer than I should because of their mistakes."
2693172,"I started searching for jobs online, I uploaded my resume to several positions at XXXX. One day I got an email for a personal assistant from this person called "" XXXX XXXX '' he said he was very interested and offered me the job because of his busy schedule. He said he was an artist,  and traveled a lot so he needed someone to make the orders, take them from suppliers and all the personal duties he could n't be able to do. He said he was gon na send me the check immediately for me to go and get the materials he would need and my payment from there, so he sent an envelope via USPS with a check inside, the person apparently sending this mail was : XXXX XXXX. Address on envelope : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, IN, XXXX. Inside of the envelope was the check with my name printed from a Bank of America account and from "" supplier '' XXXX XXXX XXXX the letter said : ( with incorrect english writing ) that the check was for me to get the materials for XXXX XXXX so he could start the painting for them. So I went to Bank of America and asked the representative if it was an elegible check and she said it was and that the account existed and had funds, so I decided to open an account with Bank of America and then I deposit the check to my account. Meanwhile I was emailing and texting with this person "" XXXX XXXX '' and he was following up what I had to do each assignment, deposit, etc. I told him the funds were on hold and I started telling him what I wanted more information about : his identity. He said he was out from city and he was coming back, and he continue like that until the check was available and Then he asked me to deposit to another supplier the rest of the check ( taking my "" payment '' ) the information he gave me was : XXXX XXXX account name : XXXX XXXX. Checking account No. XXXX When he asked me to do that, I insisted on him to identify himself and he sent me some pictures of a man with artworks. But after that I also asked him for a picture of his ID with his name on it, I told him - '' cover your info I just want to see that because this is weird, more everyday. '' He was agreeing with me but at the end he said if I wanted to run with his money and that he would call autorithies, I told him absolutely not and that I only needed an identification to know who am I working with. After that my account from Bank of America was closed and freezed and I went to see what happened and the manager told me I just made a fraud to Bank of America and I can not open an account or credit at any bank in the Country, she said Bank of America ca n't or want to help or have any relation with me. I did not send any funds to anyone, the "" check '' was deposited to my account by me so they say I am part of fraud and now I ca n't get credit from nowhere because Bank of America reported me to XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. I need help I have every proof, information, emails, receiot, etc necessary I need to take this off from me. Thank you very much."
2949134,"This is a copy of the letter I sent to Chase bank. 

XX/XX/XXXX Dear Chase Bank, I am a customer with Chase bank. I am a victim of a job scam and bank scam. 
I got a job offer from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/2018 which I thought was a genuine company. They said they are an Escrow company. 
I completed my employment registration and was given tasks to make payments to clients involved in escrow. 
The company sent the money into my Chase checking account through XXXX for me to give to the escrow clients. Because I was not required to deposit checks into my account or to spend my money I thought everything was genuine. 
I did not receive any salary or bonus from them. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I found out my Chase checking account was frozen and I called Chase bank who told me someone told them the money deposited into my account was not authorized by them, Chase bank told me the froze the account to conduct their own investigation. Then I realized I was a victim of scam. 

The scammer called Chase bank to make himself or herself the victim and me the culprit to get back all the money they sent. I am the real victim with sleepless nights and my bank account frozen and reported to XXXX. I waited for weeks for the bank investigators to contact me and hear from me, no one contacted me from the bank. This is where Chase bank erred, if they had contacted me to find out my story they would have got to the bottom of finding the culprits before making a decision to revert the payment. 

On XX/XX/XXXX Chase bank reversed the payment to the scammer leaving a very huge deficit in my checking account. Did the scammer tell Chase I stole money from their account even when they paid it themselves. So I filed a claim with Chase bank on XX/XX/XXXX for Chase to look at my evidence and find out the real culprits before they get other victims. I called Chase bank again on XX/XX/XXXX where I was told to submit copies of my evidence to any Chase branch manager in XXXX, Texas. I was able to do so on XX/XX/XXXX. Also see Case Number- XXXX XXXX XXXX where all the evidence to support my claim was provided. 
Hoping the deficit will soon be reversed. 
Thank you for your consideration. 
Truly yours, XXXX XXXX"
3082144,"I came across a job scam situation where the criminal tricked me to deposit a bad check and telling me to give them a cashier 's check. As soon as I deposit a {$5400.00} cashier 's check on XX/XX/2018 to their specific account, I realize I have been scammed and I went back to my Citi bank to ask for help. The personal banker "" XXXX XXXX '' just straight up told me she doesn't know how to help me and just gave me her business card tell me to go home and call costumer support. After I came back home and researched for the costumer support number, called in, the operator asked for the account I deposit to and telling me that she will froze my account and stop the money from going out and told me to call back and check the next day. So I called in the next day, they told me they can't see anything because my account is frozen, telling me to call back again. Therefore, I have been keep calling them back for about a week, at first, every time I called in they reassured me that everything will be fine and telling me to call back another day. Until they finally told me that the check was returned again and they didn't save my money. I felt that my bank has mistreated my situation and did not provide me the most appropriate help, and wasted my time, when I could have a more professional banker 's correct guidance tell me to go back to XXXX XXXX XXXX for a reverse transaction on the cashier check I deposited. Now my checking account is over drawn since I only left {$1000.00} in there and Citi is forcing me to pay back the rest to make up the lost of {$5400.00} or else they will do a debt collection and close my account."
3139446,"West Coast Servicing, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX / XXXX XXXX   XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX TX XXXX are using illegal and Fraudulent tactics/actions to collect a debt amount that is not owed. 

In XXXX XXXX XXXX, we had a 15 yr. loan @ 13 % with XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, & XXXX and the maturity of the loan was XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 

Each of the before mentioned finance companies ALL were frankly taken over by XXXX. 

After falling behind on taxes, it was made good in a court action, to which back taxes were brought current in a chapter XXXX proceeding. In the repayment plan, XXXX XXXX XXXX. also collected over {$17000.00}, {$12000.00}, and over {$5000.00} in lump sums, in addition to my monthly payments of {$2000.00}. 

Now that everything was current, while in court, the Trustee also approved the Payoff Application that I made to XXXX, while we were in Court XXXX agreed. Only it was a Ploy/stalling tactic to move out of the "" Eyes '' of the law. After court, XXXX resumed taking monthly payments, but XXXX NEVER resumed sending the official "" Statements '' as required by Law. 

None of the Lump sum totals Mentioned above are reflected on our loan account from XXXX, after I requested a summary of my account with them. 

In XXXX, I paid an undertaking of {$10000.00} to XXXX XXXX XXXX office. Now, this lump sum, I was told by XXXX XXXX XXXX office that this Lump sum was going to be applied to the Balloon payment becoming due XX/XX/XXXX. 

Again, the facts relating to ALL the Lumps sums paid were hidden and NEVER applied to my account. Even with the breakdown of specific fees relating to attorney fees and related court cost, none of my lump sum payments are posted on my account. 

I have ordered the bank records and the chapter XXXX & XXXX records. Subsequently, XXXX record does not reflect payments made through the Chapters either. 

In XXXX, XXXX transferred us while officially in the midst of a Modification. IT is worth mentioning again, XXXX continued to accept monthly payments, but a XXXX Workout Specialist verbally said they didn't know what to do with my account because after XXXX XXXX, XXXX they were not obligated to send out "" Monthly Statements. '' I was confused by this because I felt I should know how the money that I continued to send, was going to be applied. In XXXX XXXX, I was sent notice of an upcoming transfer to XXXX XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX, never sent any documentation of any to our residence. Nor did XXXX continue with the Modification application. 

In a matter of 8 months, XXXX transferred the Debt to XXXX XXXX  with notice. Ever since then, No one has given us an documentation that reflects an accurate record to include ALL of the above amounts paid. 

Moreover, Its like a Con-job/SCAM more than anything! I have been finically harmed and deceived, plus subjected to harassment! 

West Coast Serving has never provided me with servicing. In fact, Section 5 of RESPA ( 12 U.S.C.S ) 2605 gives the consumer rights. 

Given the laws on the books to protect consumers, it is my legal right to submit as truth and fact, that I was never given any proper/official Not of Transfer as required by law. 

West Coast Servicing, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX intentionally violated the law and must STILL be held to accountable to the Law according to Section 6 of RESPA. 

Further, the law provides for damages and cost for individuals where Servicers are shown to have violated the requirements of this section according to transfer Practices and Requirements. 

Please note, West Coast Servicing has never sent any documentation reflecting ANY of the above payments previously made to XXXX. 

It is my firm belief and testimony that XXXX has never correctly applied money paid to their representing attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and further the additional monies paid thereafter up until XXXX, and in XXXX, we prepaid our property taxes. 

Now, our property taxes are once again delinquent. Plus, we are experiencing roof leaks from the serve weather and our heating unit is in need of immediate replacement. 

Since all the repairs are costly, We are stuck between a rock and hard spot because we need a home equity loan to address all the repairs needed that's also long over due. 

West Coast Servicing and XXXX have violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act."
3194894,"XXXX does no have fraud protection and a scammer was able to defraud me using XXXX which does not have the same service protections as XXXX. I lost XXXX XXXX out of my Navy Federal Credit Union checking account. The seller asked me to pay them through XXXX instead of my preference of XXXX for an anonymous transaction. I was not aware of XXXX, did a little XXXX to read up on it and discovered its a digital payments service thats backed by Navy Federal Credit Union which made me feel more comfortable about the transaction. The seller told me to use the XXXX mobile application so I thought XXXX was a legit service, and assumed Navy Federal Credit Union would step in to help if anything went wrong. After all, I was sending money directly to another bank account so surely the seller would know they could be tracked down and caught if they attempt fraud?! Unfortunately, proved to not be the case as the seller actually a scammer kept the money, his phone was turned off ; he never responded to any emails- he was gone and I never received the product/service paid for. I filed a complaint with Navy Federal Credit Union. I am unaware if Navy Federal Credit Union 's fraud department tried to call the seller 's bank to follow up on the matter. Navy Federal Credit Union sent me a letter stating theres nothing they can do to help recoup the stolen money. When I emailed a complaint to XXXX Support to help, XXXX responded by sharing a link that explained why XXXX should only be used with family and friends and that XXXX is not responsible for goods or services that are not received.

The program offered consumers help in getting jobs with the USPS and guaranteed them job placement if they were able to get a certain score on the USPS entrance exam. In reality, jobs, or even the opportunity to apply for jobs, were not available through the defendants. For many consumers, the advertised postal jobs were not available in their area at all. The FTC alleged the defendants, XXXX XXXX XXXX and his companies, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ; XXXX XXXX, XXXX ; and XXXX XXXX, XXXX, doing business as XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX, put classified ads in newspapers across the country. The ads, which read $ ATTENTION $  Now Hiring for Postal Jobs and offered hourly salary rates, paid training and full benefits, led consumers to believe the defendants were connected with the USPS and the hiring process. When consumers called the toll-free numbers listed in the ads, they were told there were jobs available at their local post office. The defendants offered consumers an exam-preparation package and told consumers they had to pay a one-time refundable fee for the study materials. According to the defendants, the materials would assist consumers in getting jobs with the USPS by helping them pass the required entrance exam. The defendants also told consumers that if they scored high enough on the exam, they would receive immediate job placement. The defendants said that their product would include an employment application, a book entitled XXXX XXXX XXXX, 12 practice exams, and a copy of the actual exam.

He said that I can purchase a shelf/aged corporation but I didn't want to pay for a shelf corporation. He then said I have to pay him {$4000.00} to fix my credit, and he would help me create an LLC and establish business credit. He said he sells CPNs and I told him that I wasn't interested so he told me that he could use his own tradelines to boosts my credit. He said he would also use 'credit masking ' to correct two personal lines which would hinder his ability to help me obtain business credit. He said it would take him 30-120 days to help me with my personal credit but he would then be able to obtain XXXX in business lines of credit through his private list of lenders he works with. He would then take the XXXX and place it into his 'leveraged brokerage account ' he would take {$2500.00} x 6 payments to pay the broker account and the rest would go into a treasury bond and the bond would give me dividends of $ XXXX which I could use to pay the XXXX line of credit he would obtain for me ... He then would take tradelines/'enhancements ' and add them to the personal and business LOC and he mentioned a 'stand by letter of credit ' being used but did not specifiy what the letter was for or why it was needed. He said after 90 -  120 days my business credit will be fully established. He then brought up CPN usages and how it is legal to use per IRS stating he uses CPNs all the time to create several C corporations and he builds up the corporations and pumps credit into them, uses them and then bankrupts them and he has been in the credit business for ten years. He also asked me for a list of my credit cards for credit repair and when I gave him the list he told me he would pay me to allow him to put authorized users onto my credit cards however I told him that I wasn't interested as I had been a victim of identity theft and just wanted to fix my credit and to establish business credit. He then asked me to send him {$4000.00} for his services using XXXX and he would get started on the "" unique program he created for my specific situation. '' It all sounded fishy to me and I called him and told him that it sounded weird and I wanted to cancel. He told me that I was already in some system and it would take a while for him to take me out of the system and refund my money. When I asked him when I would get my money back he said he had to reach out to his partners ( aka himself ) to ask when they could refund the money but he doesn't not have any partners. I then asked specifically when he would give me my money back he wouldn't give me a specific day ( e.g. 24, 48, 72 hours ). Thank goodness only {$500.00} went through and not the {$4000.00}. I told him to just send my {$500.00} back through XXXX and he said it wasn't that easy to do. He told me that he would email me and hung up. Calling his phone back - it went straight to a full voice mail and he did not respond to email. Did not respond to text. I did not have a written contract with XXXX, he just asked me to send him money through XXXX. He told me it would be {$4000.00} and then I told him I wasn't paying that so he dropped his service down to {$2000.00} and I then told him after a few hours to just cancel service. He offers a guarantee on his website but does not specify what it covers. After my complaint he had his virtual assistant change the wording. He did not provide me with any service - just took my money and disappeared.

My bank has said theres nothing they can do once I started to suspect anything and XXXX has only sent an email saying they are not responsible. Hours after this happened while I was on hold with my bank for 1 hour I was losing access to mobile banking. Since I am unemployed and have only the government funds I receive for unemployment I now am required to use that money to live off of and start making payments to my bank for the transaction. I am upset because I disputed these transactions and us bank ran an investigation which no one contacted me to inquire about this and they do not have all the details so how did they complete the investigation? XXXX needs to take out their main add that they are backed by big banks so its safer than XXXX. And the banks need to help us as our financial institution.

4239683,"Description sent to the FBI and FTC I am currently unemployed and applied for a job using XXXX on XXXX. It was XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX position at a XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). On XXXX I received an email response and was invited for an interview via XXXX with XXXX XXXX. She offered me the job, sent me paperwork to sign, and said they would be purchasing a computer and equipment for me to use. They sent a XXXX  check for the equipment in the amount of {$4800.00}. The checked looked very professional so I deposited it. I've been out of work for soo long and was very excited to get started. They said the check would take 2-3 days to clear, so I offered to use my money to pay the local vendor while their check clears. I went to the bank, got a cashiers check and used it to transfer {$4500.00} to the account they said was their local vendor, who would put everything together and would deliver. The vendor Mr XXXX XXXX texted me and asked to verify my address for the delivery. Meanwhile they asked for a picture of my driver 's license for a background check and had me email it to XXXX When I started getting suspicious I found out the address on their check is the same address for a liquor store in Illinois. I asked XXXX to respond to a XXXX connect/message to verify her authenticity, XXXX XXXX repeatedly assured me that she would, but I never received a response from the real XXXX XXXX on XXXX. Before the interview, I looked up the XXXX Job description but the page was not there. I thought the employer simply stopped taking new applicants. XXXX took down the page and left no warning for me or others. Chase bank lifted the hold on the deposited check and rejected the transfer due to the account being closed. They would not reverse the {$4500.00} transfer either. Furthermore I received a call on XXXX from a real estate agent XXXX of XXXX Georgia asking for a XXXX who had registered my phone number on a XXXX ad. It's a very odd coincidence, hopefully nothing but I am now afraid someone is using my identity. 

The reason I am reporting this to the FBI is that it involves more than one state. I live in California, the check 's address is in Illinois, XXXX is in XXXX Virginia, XXXX is in XXXX XXXX or at least that's where their phones originate from. The communication was through email, XXXX, and text messages from 2 phone numbers ( XXXX XXXX Virginia XXXX ) and ( XXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). 

Please Note the XXXX account is still active and I am still getting responses. It is possible to trace a XXXX IP address using a XXXX machine and running a trace route using XXXX command prompt. All I would need to do is allow you access to my XXXX account and you could find this person 's IP address.

4266841,"Dear CFPB, In XXXX I was the VICTIM of some of the very best and earliest scams relating to jobs, scams relating to deposits sent from Mobile phones and such. I lost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Most recently I have been working globally the past 5 years in XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have opened an XXXX, Chase and XXXX accounts here in the US along with an XXXX XXXX account. 

One month ago, I received two checks from XXXX XXXX XXXX from the XXXX XXXX XXXX. I told her specifically NOT to send checks rather I do not work in checks, nor do I issue checks anymore. I stated that cash wire transfers or Bank to Bank transfers were the only acceptable methods of deposit. When the two checks ( {$8000.00} and {$46000.00} ) From two foundations arrived I drove 3 hours to the XXXX, NY branch of XXXX to meet with the nearest branch Vice President. While on the phone with my partner, former banker 27 years and head of the JP Morgan Trade desk, I instructed this XXXX of XXXX to authenticate the checks first, note the account and alert the fraud department because I could not vouch for the checks. AND, if they were no good, NOT to deposit them into my account!!! A few days later I find out that they are closing the account. My boss, the CEO of XXXX XXXX in XXXX ( where we have $ XXXX in XXXX XXXX ) spoke with XXXX ( CEO of XXXX ) explained what happened and asked him to speak with XXXX XXXX the CEO of XXXX US. My XXXX account has now gone from pending closure back to under review. The account will remain open. 

While in XXXX, I opened a JP Morgan Chase account right next door. I was thrilled!! I moved {$100.00} from XXXX to Chase and set up two direct deposits. As of today, there was {$750.00} in the account. Deposits only, no withdrawals, no other activity. Today I receive a notice that Chase is closing my account. I called Chase, they can give me no reason why they are closing the account. There have been no checks deposited, no wires sent out, nothing that violates our agreement upon opening the account. Needless to say, I am flat out furious, enraged and disappointed in the entire US Banking system!!! 

When and how am I supposed to set up proper banking and have deposits of larger funds come into the US without proper banking support. The XXXX inside XXXX in XXXX New York was XXXX XXXX, she knows she did NOT do her job, she did not advise me they do not authenticate checks first, she did not note the account and she did not advise to the fraud department. Now, I am supposed to be the victim again for some employee who cant do her job properly?? With regards to Chase, they have NO GOOD REASON to close my account and I would like it re opened asap. 
Thank you XXXX"

What's the status - has Bank of America received my first HH letter sent directly from XXXX for processing? A second attempt Hold Harmless Letter was also sent to BOA via BOA Secure Messaging.

I also went ahead called the school district, XXXX XXXX XXXX to verify if they were the ones who hosted the job listing, to which it was verified they did not, but they did have it for a XXXX position which has already been filled. I went to the bank Friday with photocopy evidence of our exchange to show that I truly thought it was a legitimate job offer, and that I wouldn't deposit a fake check as a member who just got my account out of the negative due to being homeless and unemployed. My bank will not reverse the funds, even though the representative I spoke to Monday inspected the check, and a different representative I spoke to Friday stated that this was a "" common thing '' that happens, which I found odd because why not place proper protocols for people who are innocent so they won't be at risk?? The money orders were sent to an address in XXXX, TX, which they may not be at anymore.

5541457,"I was the victim of a part time job scam. The company promised me payment of {$300.00} / week for having advertising decals put on my car, and sent me a check that included funds for the first week and {$3000.00} to pay the person that was putting the decals on the car. I transferred the funds as soon as the check cleared the bank. Then the company told me that the person coming to place the decals was in an accident and that they were setting up someone else to receive the funds. They then sent me an additional check for {$3000.00} that check cleared U.S Bank ( where I've banked for 20 year ) or so I thought. I transferred the funds to the next person and as soon as I did that, my account was locked. The message I received was on my mobile banking app was that I couldn't get into my account because of a problem on U.S. Bank 's end. I didn't find out until later that day that my account was locked due to fraudulent activity. I left a message on the e-fraud officer 's line and never received a call back. The check cleared on XX/XX/2022 and I reported the fraud at XXXX that evening after I found out why my account was locked. I NEVER received any notice from U.S. Bank that there was an issue on my end or that the check had bounced. 

After not hearing back from the e-fraud representative I called U.S Bank fraud line again on XX/XX/XXXX, in the morning. I reported the whole issue to someone at U.S. Bank who said they would do an investigation and that a branch manager was the only one that could reopen my account. On XX/XX/XXXX in the afternoon I called the branch manager who said that he couldn't reopen my account until we had funds to put in as the transfers and bounced check left us with a - {$800.00} balance. On Thursday afternoon XX/XX/XXXX, I called the fraud line again to see how the investigation was progressing, I spoke with someone in the e-fraud and fraud departments who said that my account was being closed, and our mortgage payment, which had been issued on XX/XX/XXXX had been sent back, resulting in the overage being paid back and insufficient funds AND a {$100.00} late fee for paying our mortgage. The U.S. Bank fraud representative told me that I was the one who had committed fraud and therefore, I was not eligible for an account with them. I was also told that they would not be doing an investigation into the scam or into the XXXX accounts of the unknown people that I made payments to. There was no attempt to gather the documented information that I had and essentially U.S. Bank refused to help at all. So, now we are out the {$2500.00} that we transferred to the scammers AND we are out bounced check fees and another couple of hundred for returned payment fees on bills that we had scheduled to be paid. AND we have to wait another 4-10 business days to get the remainder of the returned mortgage payment to try and open a new checking account somewhere else. We will NEVER use any U.S Bank account or product again as I feel like they have been complicit with the scammers in taking advantage of an already horrible situation and charging us added fees AND making us out to the be the ones guilty of fraud. I hope that no one ever has to experience a situation like this and that people pull their accounts from U.S. Bank and invest somewhere else."

I believed the check was legitimate because money was available to withdraw. {$2200.00} was clearly deposited into my account. I as a customer believed Chase. Chase should have not cleared the check if the check was altered or fraudulent because chase did not clear the XXXX check ( {$3000.00} ) Chase then found out a few days later the check was altered and took the {$2200.00} out of my account and also charges me {$12.00} for altered check. Chase should have not cleared the check at the first time. I as a customer believed that the check was legitimate I had no idea the checks were fraud!! Why did Chase clear the deposit and money was available. I would not made XXXX payments to scammers if chase did not clear my deposit. If chase found it earlier if check was altered. I lost money to scammers but I think I lost it to Chase not scammers. Chase should have not deposit my check. Chase should have found out the check was altered I could have prevented the scammers if Chase did not clear the check like the XXXX check i am a victim of scammers and Chase deposit department.
5668688,"During the week of XX/XX/XXXX, I was contacted by "" XXXX '' from "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' ( supposedly located in XXXX, GA ) about a proofreading and copyediting job that I applied for on a freelancing platform called XXXX. She said that I would be a good candidate for the position, and her associate, "" XXXX XXXX, '' will get in touch with me over XXXX should I be selected for the role. After talking to XXXX, she informed me that I had been selected for the role. She sent me an offer letter for me to sign and return, and startup funds totaling {$4600.00} to purchase work equipment ( i.e., XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and installation & handling fee ). On Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX instructed me to contact the company 's approved vendor representative, "" XXXX XXXX, '' via text message to transfer the funds through XXXX to purchase the necessary work equipment. XXXX instructed me to transfer the funds in {$500.00} increments. After I transferred a total of {$1500.00}, my bank ( i.e., Bank of America ) alerted me that this was a scam and that I should stop all communications with these individuals. In total, I lost {$1500.00} to this job scam. 

I filed a claim with my bank immediately to see if they would credit the amount that I transferred to XXXX. However, after waiting for a period of 12 days, Bank of America informed me that they were unable to approve my claim because their records indicated that the transfers were completed according to my instructions, so, therefore, no errors occurred on their end. I'm disappointed in their response because I believed my situation met the parameters set forth under Regulation E ; however, there was no mention of that anywhere in their letter. They are currently in touch with the bank that received my transfers ( i.e., XXXX XXXX ) in an attempt to recover the funds. This may take up to 45 days ( as of XX/XX/XXXX )."

After weeks of contacting the FTC, Wellsfargo, XXXX and the fbis online fraud I have not gotten any help with retrieving my lost funds. My bank hasnt done anything besides contact the scammers bank and try to offer a refund too no avail. Now my account is in the negatives and I cant even close it out."
5793778,"I was involved in a job scam. I was offered a job as an assistant to a lawyer who sent me a check which he asked me to donate to a charity. I received the check on XX/XX/2022 in the amount of {$4900.00}. I was instructed to deposit it into my bank account and send {$1500.00} through Venmo to an account named XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2022. I then found out that the check was fraudulent, and it bounced leaving my account balance at $ XXXX. XXXX and Venmo both have proven unhelpful in having the money returned to me."
5801649,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a job offer from XXXX XXXX XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, the company informed me that to start my training I needed new office equipment because the company forbid the use of personal computers. XXXX told me they would send me a start-up check of {$8900.00} so I can acquire the equipments. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a check for {$8900.00} from XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was told to deposit the check into my account at any ATM, which I did because Bank of America was closed by the time I received the check. By XX/XX/XXXX, I checked my online bank account and the check had cleared. I tried to purchase the office equipment online from a website provided to me by XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ). Bank of America did not permit the online transfer, and Bank of America told me I would have to go to a physical bank to be able to send the funds to XXXX XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I went to the Bank of America location closest to my house ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX  XXXX, Oklahoma XXXX ). I asked the bank teller assisting me if the check for {$8900.00} from XXXX had cleared and if the funds were available to me, and they said yes. XXXX told me to get a cashier 's check in the amount of {$8600.00} to pay for the office equipments and make it payable to XXXX XXXX ( an alleged supervisor for XXXX XXXX ), and deposit it into her account at XXXX XXXX  XXXX So, after getting the cashier 's check from Bank of America, I proceeded to XXXX XXXX  to deposit it, as instructed by XXXX. 

A few hours after depositing the cashier 's check at XXXX, Bank of America had notified me that the original check from XXXX for {$8900.00} had been put on hold and the funds were no longer available to me. I called Bank of America to inquire about why the check was suddenly being put on hold after the bank teller told me the check cleared and the funds were made available to me in a cashier 's check. Bank of America told me that the reason why the check was being put on hold was because the check was large, so it would take a few more days to go through. I questioned Bank of America, asking why they would initially clear a check and make funds available without verifying the check first. At this time, the cashier 's check Bank of America had issued to XXXX XXXX had already been cashed by XXXX XXXX, leaving my bank account with a negative balance because the funds from the {$8900.00} check were suddenly no longer available. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America closed my account without notifying me first. I called them to find out why my account had been closed, and they told me it was because I had deposited a fraudulent check from XXXX for {$8900.00}. I explained on the phone that I had no clue it was a counterfeit check, and I deposited the check into my account under the assumption it was legitimate. I questioned the representative I spoke to, asking again why Bank of America cleared the check and made the funds available without verifying the check first. The representative I spoke to was unable to give me a direct answer. 

I then pieced together that the job offer I received from XXXX and the XXXX XXXX website provided to me was a scam. 

When Bank of America closed my account, they took all the money that was in checking and savings account, which totaled to {$6700.00}. They then proceeded to go to my mom 's savings account ( because my account is linked to hers ) and they took out {$1800.00} as a transfer to overdrawn related account. In total, Bank of America took {$8600.00}. 

I filed a police report about the job scam. I sent a copy of the police report and other related documents, including specific information about the job scam, the name of the account holder and the account number of where the cashier 's check was deposited into at XXXX XXXX, to Bank of America so they could conduct an investigation. 

I have been calling Bank of America about the ongoing investigation for almost 3 months, asking whether they have been able to retrieve the funds from XXXX XXXX  ( where the cashier 's check was deposited ). Every time I call, Bank of America tells me the investigation is still ongoing. 

In actuality, Bank of America is no longer investigating the situation because they have already collected my money. This situation could have been avoided if Bank of America had verified the check from XXXX before making the funds available to me. A check for such a large amount ( {$8900.00} ) should have been verified before being made available to a customer."
5805173,"On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX messaged me on XXXX asking if I wanted money. She didn't tell me what company she worked for, she just said she ran her own business. Being an unemployed, XXXX XXXX XXXX, I needed money to pay for tuition so I said yes. She emailed me a check of {$2500.00} and then asked for me to send {$1000.00} to her grandma to pay for her medical bill. I sent the money and then she asked me to send another {$1000.00} to her doctor. My mom saw the charges and told me it was a scam and I called my bank, USAA, and explained everything that happened. They told me that I would have to pay for the money I sent even though it was a scam."
5819576,"About three weeks ago, I was involved in a job scam while looking for a summer internship. During this scam, I separately transferred {$3300.00} to the scammers through XXXX since the scammers told me I needed to purchase the training materials for that internship. For this issue, I filed complaints on CFPB two weeks ago, and Wells Fargo, the brand of banks I hold with, would like to assist me as well, so this issue was done. However, I found there was still an issue I needed to solve right now. As the scammers promised, they would reimburse the fee by sending me a picture of a check through email. That check was {$1900.00}. I scanned that check on my mobile bank APP on XX/XX/XXXX, and Wells Fargo recognized the check was fictitious, and they could not process it. Because of this issue, they had to close my bank account. I thought Wells Fargo just wanted to prevent me from further fund losses, so I applied to open another account at Wells Fargo since a banker said I was good to open another account. I opened a new bank account at a branch on XX/XX/XXXX, but I received a disclosure letter from Wells Fargo for this new account yesterday, and the reason was "" the closure by Wells Fargo or its affiliates of a previous account [ I ] owned ''. I phone-called Fraud Prevention Contact Center at Wells Fargo XXXX and the representative said that Wells Fargo could not trust me anymore just because I scanned a fictitious check, so he asked me to open a bank account at another bank 's brand. 

Although scanning and depositing a fictitious check is my fault, I am a victim of this job scam, and I just want to follow the instruction in order to have this internship since I had not doubted those people were scammers at that point. After online researching, I found I may be on XXXX. I could not accept this result, and I expect Wells Fargo to help me out of this issue because I am also a victim, so I can have a standard bank account as I used to, and I do not want this issue to negatively affect me in the future."
5833930,"I was offered a job interview with XXXX XXXX, a XXXX company. The interview was scheduled to be taken on the XXXX app ( which later I identified was used as it allows to Delete messages from the sender as well as receiver 's end ). My interview was completed by XXXX XXXX XXXX on the XXXX app via text messaging and I was offered a job on XX/XX/2022 by XXXX ( XXXX ). I had asked for three weeks before starting the new job. As per their requirements, they were supposed to send me a check for buying remote work-related equipment. I received the check by XXXX  package by XXXX XXXX and asked to communicate on XXXX. I had been communicating with both XXXX XXXX and XXXX. Once the amount was cleared by Bank of America on XX/XX/2022, and was reflected as deposited in my account balance. They asked to me to transfer {$1000.00} through XXXX from my bank account to XXXX ( XXXX ), their equipment delivery contractor who would be sending me equipment at my residential address. Once I sent screenshots of the transfer and payment confirmation, I was asked to transfer the remaining {$800.00} to her again. When asked why was the whole amount not transferred to her, I was told sometimes employees have a minimum {$1000.00} limit which leads to rejection, after which I transferred and sent the confirmation of the payment on XX/XX/2022 night. Today, on XX/XX/2022 I received an alert from Bank of America that my account balance is below {$0.00}. After checking, the check deposited was put ON HOLD as it was a fake check and scam. After trying to contact the manager XXXX XXXX, he deleted all the messages from the XXXX app and mentioned it is a fake contract. He also texted if I contact him, he will hack my bank account. I immediately contacted Bank of America, after 4 hours of waiting and talking to merely 2 people and repeating the story, Bank of America did not help me to dispute a transaction or cancel the transaction. They transferred me to XXXX who after 1 hour got connected and took my details and gave me a Case Number. They said they will try to get money from Bank of America as I have no money in my account, but they can not say anything. I reported to the local police officer, who was kind enough to take all details and screenshots and provide me with a case number. I would like to alert other people and the official company being used for this fraud."
5834474,"My name is XXXX XXXX and I am a Truist customer. I have been banking with Suntrust years prior to the merger and I've never faced fraudulent activity of this caliber since the merger of the two firms, Suntrust and BB & T. 

I have been dealing with these issues since XXXX. I am a recent XXXX XXXX looking within the job market. I was under the impression that I was employed remotely with the company XXXX, and I was sent checks for the purchase of office equipment. I sent the first check through XXXX to the "" equipment suppliers '' after doing a mobile deposit and no red flags were raised because Truist cleared this money. I believe the next day I was messaged by someone on XXXX, where I announced my job opportunity, she then alerted me that it may be a scam. These scammers sent her a check as well, but luckily for her, her bank detected that the check was fraudulent and no further action was taken. I had just been sent another check that day, which was also cleared by the bank, but instead of sending it, I let it sit within my account. 

Realizing my predicament, I sat on the phone for hours to speak with a Truist representative to get hung up on twice and then finally be told I need to go into a branch to create a claim. After that, I went to the bank to freeze the account and cancel all credits and deposits coming into the account. The money that was sitting in my account was removed by the clerk and my claim was filed. The next day a police report was filed. 

There was paperwork that needed to be filled out, it needed to be sent back into the claims department within 10 days of them sending it through the mail or your claim would become invalid. I believed this was infeasible, and after 6 days of waiting I was finally able to get a Trusit representative to email the documents because they still had not arrived in the mail. I filled out the paperwork, I added my police report case number and emailed back the documents. The original claims paperwork arrived over two weeks later, way past the 10-day period. I signed all the documents they needed me to sign to authorize the claim to remove liability from me. My claim journey began. 

( **side note : Before moving to Suntrust I was a XXXX client. I was hit with fraudulent activity there because someone got ahold of my bank information. The case was resolved, the account was closed and I was reimbursed for my loss all within the same day of filing that fraudulent claim. *** ) Truist representatives, not all but some, gave attitude to me as I tried to resolve these issues both through their call centers and within the banks. They were not very knowledgeable, every representative had a different explanation for my account and its activity. I was recommended from department to department to review my case. I was told that I would not be held liable for all the overdraft fees and miscellaneous fees that have since appeared on my account since the beginning of the claim. I was told my police report would remove liability from me to be forced to pay the fraudulent check money back. I have also been given the excuse that it takes Truist 5-7 business days before a check is reviewed through mobile deposit which is why the check was cashed. Which in turn, also means that scammers have 5-7 business days to receive the funds before Truist can identify that the activity is fraudulent. Allowing these organizations to cash checks that can not be tracked or traced back to the person the money was sent to. 

My account is now - ( {$2000.00} ) dollars and my claim for reimbursement has been denied because, according to the mail I received, "" The client has not suffered a net loss of funds ''. I've called multiple and different departments about this decision, I was told there was nothing they could do and I was told to report to a branch. I reported to a branch and they told me there is nothing they could do, I need to call the department. I was sent back and forth before finally being told my account is still under investigation, which disregards and invalidates the letter I received. The teller could not hand me any tangible proof that my case was still under investigation. I quote, "" They're trying to get them, the scammers, to send the money back. '' So my question was, "" Will I still be held liable if the scammers dont send the money back? I can guarantee they will not, it's their job as scammers. '' Then the teller shrugged as a response. 

I, again, called multiple departments to file a rebuttal because I was constantly being redirected or told it's a different department that handles rebuttal claims. After two weeks, I was finally able to get the rebuttal filed. Again, I received no tangible paperwork to support the claim through email or mail. By mid-XXXX, Truist sent me a notice saying that the account will be closed and the difference left will be reported to my credit. I called the bank to be told my rebuttal has not been recognized in the system yet. After another two weeks, I reached out again because I had not heard from them. As I predicted, they could not obtain the money their system cleared and sent to the scammers, so my rebuttal was denied. 

As I said earlier, I am a recent XXXX XXXX. I have a XXXX  checking account with Truist. It is not fair of Truist, as a bank, to have a faulty system where their customers lie and remain the main victims. The firm is refusing to take any blame for the activity among customer accounts. They simply released a statement saying that, "" Our customers are our main priority ... '' but show otherwise when their customers need them.

Waiting within the lobby areas of Truist branches to speak with representatives, I learned I was not the only one there disputing a fraudulent charge on an account. Suntrust customers are reporting checks being cashed that 1. ) weren't even endorsed and 2. ) are BB & T checks. These customers have been with Suntrust for 10+ years and never BB & T, yet the bank still allowed these checks to not only be cleared but dispersed. I've researched more and found that since the merger, I am not the only one who has had issues with Truist and their fraud security problem. Small businesses, families and individuals alike have all been negatively affected because scammer organizations realize there is weakness in Truist 's security and these scam organizations are exploiting it. Instead of Truist protecting and helping minimize the damages occured, we, the customers, are being blamed and held liable for the occurence. 

Truist 's customers are the ones who are truly being harmed from their lack of security since this merger. This is not just about mobile deposits, there are cases where people have checks being cashed from outside of the state in which they reside and Truist is clearing them, leaving people with over $ XXXX worth of losses. The bank doesn't reimburse this money to clients, cardholders are expected to pay it back to the bank. 

Truist bank is active on social media platforms in order to speak directly with their clients. Since the fraudulent activity, clients have spilled into their comments throughout different social media platforms expressing their frustrations and anger with Trusit bank. Since then, the bank has cut off their commenting on all their social platforms, they've stopped responding to customer direct messaging through these platforms, and they've also had their representatives on XXXX cut off their messaging ability. The bank is closing off communication from their clients. Call centers and branch visits go nowhere. 

I have filed a complaint with the XXXX  and I am filing a complaint with the Department of Banking and Finance as well as Consumer Finance. We, their customers, are being ignored and forced to pay money to them for their faults. I don't believe that is fair, also considering that prior to the merger, both Suntrust and BB & T were fairly trusted banks. Now, customers are pulling their money from Truist and banking elsewhere before any more damages can be done. A firm that publicly claims to have their customers best interest prioritized yet ignores their customer in their time of need"
5844349,"Hello I was recently victim of a work at home job scam which eventually lead to the closing of my bank account being closed. My bank ( Wells Fargo ) had put a check through which I received at the inception of this scam but lead me to believe that this entity was legitimate. Especially since I had recently been informed of a charge in XXXX which they contact me on and I denied so they closed my account with my permission and sent me a new card with a new ATM number and also, I am going through a separation/divorce and my partner deposited funds on the second settlement from a savings account rather than the checking he normally did and the bank froze the funds for 7 days. With this kind of protection in the recent past I assumed that when the check cleared from the unknown scammers it was a sign that the bank authorized it and it was a legitimate account. After the so-called job HR person had me transferring funds via money apps I figured something was not right. Three days later my bank sent me an email telling me they closed my account and the check was a fraud.

I contacted them and told what happened and they reopened a new account for me but placed the fraud check charges into my new account as a debit and has left me negative and anything I deposit as payment for this scam. I have sent them all of the documentation of the scam and asked for a manager to contact me ( see below ) but received no response. 

What can I do? 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, CA XXXX mobile. XXXX email. XXXX Email to Wells Fargo Online Fraud Department : Dear Online Fraud Department, I called on Friday to request that a manager call me regarding several claims that are being investigated due to a work scam I fell victim to. At the present time my account ( ATM # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) is in a negative balance due to transfer done using apps and cash at an XXXX atm. The whole start of this process began when a check was deposited by myself via mobile app ad was approved by Wells Fargo it was that moment when I assumed that the individuals I were dealing with were legitimate. I have had experiences with Wells Fargo where I was protected immediately one a deposit from my husband for a settlement that was made from a different account and these funds were held for 7 days. Another is a call from Wells Fargo where some activity was occurring in a foreign country and I was contacted and the charges were stopped and my account closed and a new card issued. 

I find it hard to believe that a fraud check would not have been caught within the days that it took to contact me regarding these scammers. 

I am now in the process of a divorce and limited on funds and my account has already begun sending back charges due to the negative amount from this scam. 

I would like to speak to a manager and go over what I feel, as a member of Wells Fargo for over 25 years are having to feel the impact of a scam. 

Thank you for your time and attention. My contact info is below."
5903957,"I have been looking for a job opportunity as I have been unemployed. On XX/XX/2022, I received an email from XXXX of a job opportunity that looked promising. The position looked legitimate from the job description ; I applied on the same day. On XX/XX/2022, I received an invitation for an interview with a XXXX hiring manager and I conducted that interview remotely the same day. I asked for time to review the job offer and ask questions, to which the hiring manager obliged. 

I received the job offer by email on XX/XX/2022 and was able to ask questions via email. They answered appropriately. I thought that I found a good XXXX XXXX position ; but, looking back on it, the job was too good to be true. Between XX/XX/2022 and XX/XX/2022, I was given checks from XXXX ( 1 deposited physically and 4 to mobile deposit into my checking account at Citizens Bank, of whom I have been a loyal customer for over 20 years ) ; and, I was instructed by CardConnect hiring department employees to use these checks for payments toward a work laptop, software, and office set-up. Five of these payments were instructed to be done via XXXX for a total of {$5000.00} sent via XXXX : on XX/XX/2022, {$1000.00} was instructed to be sent ( image attached is associated with this transaction ) ; XX/XX/2022, {$1000.00} was instructed to be sent ; on XX/XX/2022, {$1000.00} was instructed to be sent ; on XX/XX/2022, {$1000.00} was instructed to be sent ; on XX/XX/2022, {$1000.00} was instructed to be sent. 

Unfortunately, on XX/XX/2022, I recognized that my bank gradually returned the deposited XXXX checks. So, effectively, my own funds were used. On XX/XX/2022 and XX/XX/2022, I tried to ask XXXX to reimburse me, but they gave me the run around and not paid me back. Following my late realization, on XX/XX/2022, I filed a report with my local police precinct and submitted a claim about these XXXX transactions with Citizens Bank. My local police precinct deems this entire situation as fraud and is investigating as such ; Citizens Bank should do the same. I also filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission."
6184246,"I am a victim of a job scam, on XX/XX/XXXX as an employee under the person I was told to deposit {$9000.00} to my personal account from a beneficiary account. The employer gave me all the information to add the external account. Bank of America has a verification system for external accounts so I thought this was secure. I was to used the funds to buy bitcoin which I was able to do with {$8000.00} but not the {$1000.00}. The bank said they decided to close my account without any details. At this point I realized I was in a job scam and cut contact from the employer. I reported it to the FBI and called Bank of America in helping the resolution. Later in the year I was told that I would need to pay back the {$8000.00} myself so I filed a claim to dispute the charge. The charge was not lifted due to the fact that I used my card and that their records show a receipt of transaction. But it is still fraud, I faxed 50 pages of evidence with different interactions between me and the scammer and still they stayed with their decision. They clearly don't care about the principal of fraud and more so that it was XXXX being owed. Not their money not their problem so instead of doing a proper investigation they have punished me."
6419337,"After applying for work on an online site, I was offered a proofreading position on XX/XX/XXXX and on the next day put into contact with alleged employers of XXXX magazine, represented by a "" XXXX XXXX '' via XXXX who informed me I would be sent funds ( {$2000.00} ) to pay for supplies needed for work which would come as a check in .pdf form. I was instructed by XXXX to use my bank, XXXX 's, mobile deposit feature to deposit the check and further instructed to send 2 {$1000.00} increments to a "" local vender, '' using XXXX to a party identified as XXXX XXXX at XXXX, to acquire the needed supplies ( I did inquire with my bank about depositing the sent check in such a way and they actually advised me how to do it ). 

XXXX seemed to approve the deposit, having the transaction change from "" pending '' to not- '' pending '' the next day ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and even assuring {$500.00} was readily available ; I believed the funds were received and was only able to send one {$1000.00} transaction as there was a {$1500.00} limitation to XXXX XXXX. 

I contacted XXXX to inform her of the limitations and even offered to send an additional {$500.00} as I was eager to receive the needed supplies and starting work. XXXX then became insistent I contact to bank and request they lift the limitation. When I next contacted the bank with this request they informed me this was a known scam and they would suspend the {$2000.00} deposit. At first I was in disbelief as they had apparently approved the {$2000.00} deposit and made me believe it was legit but then said due to me being a "" first level '' customer with no history of bad checks they approved the deposit in full before actually confirming funds were deliverable ; hence, that {$1000.00} XXXX payment came from my own funds. XXXX then informed me they'd hold the deposit ( sending an email that day confirming this ) and dispute the XXXX transaction which had gone through already. They advised me to cease contact with XXXX and send no more money. XXXX, meanwhile, would attempt communication with me throughout the XXXX weekend and a couple of days following, even suggesting sending the rest of the money to a different XXXX account. 

In the time that followed, XXXX continued to send me contradictory communication : on XX/XX/XXXX they sent an email saying {$2000.00} was withdrawn from my account, seemingly indicating they were removing the amount I was erroneously made to believe went through. The next day they sent an email then saying the deposited check didn't go through and was returned. Then on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX then sent an email saying the deposit hold was released and the {$2000.00} deposited in my account. However, that day I then received XXXXwo hard copy items in my mailbox : one was a returned deposited item notice dated XX/XX/XXXX that included a copy of the {$2000.00} check sent to me by XXXX that was described as "" altered/fictitious '', which included wording a fee would be charged to me for it being returned ; the other was a notice dated XX/XX/XXXX saying the {$2000.00} would be available on XX/XX/XXXX, emphasizing "" a portion '' of that deposit would be made available for immediate withdrawal, as per their "" funds availability policy '', which seems a pretty insecure practice to me as it misled me. I later received another hardcopy notice dated XX/XX/XXXX saying the {$1000.00} XXXX transaction would not be refunded, claiming their research confirmed it was applied as I "" instructed '', regardless of my reporting it as a fraud the day they told me the practice was a scam. Not once did they ask for the proof I had on my end showing I was deceived by "" XXXX '' and others seemingly involved in manipulating and inducing me to fall prey to this in the form of screen grabs depicting the communication that was involved. 

In the days that have followed XXXX has frozen my account without informing me, making me delinquent in a credit card payment that has now resulted in my credit card being frozen too. 

I need help and hope the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( Reg. E ) is applicable and can get my money and financial security back, especially at a time when I'm unemployed and have had too much taken from me."

I would then be paid the remaining compensation the day of the shoot. 

I deposited the check sent to me, and the funds were available by my bank ( BoA ) the next day.

I immediately notified Bank Of America fraud department ( 1 day after sending XXXX XXXX and explained the job scam that I was a victim of. I attempted to get the money back from the fake company, but was unsuccessful.

There were XXXX different checks that needed to be deposited so that I could provide money to vendors for equipment and materials. The first check was for {$2400.00}. There was only a 48 hour hold on the check and then the funds were released. The 2nd check was for {$2500.00} and those funds were also held only for a brief time and then released for usage. The institution, TD Bank did not validate the funds of those checks before releasing them to my account for usage. They released them with only a short hold so that these fraudulent checks were available. Had I not had access during the period of the scam that I was involved in, convincing me I was getting paid for this great work from home position, I would never have been able to send the funds to the random "" vendors '' I was instructed to. TD Bank did not do their due diligence in verifying any of the information prior to release. I have had checks in the past held for many more days that were in fact legit and had to be verified ( anywhere from 5-7 days minimum )! I tried to go into the branch when I realized what had happened on XX/XX/23 and although I was scammed, they told me it was fault and I would be held responsible for the funds I already released to these various vendors. This bank should never have released those funds to me and instead should have only charged a return check fee ( which they have now done but also included the high amounts I now have to pay back to the institution ). TD Bank needs to be held accountable for there lack of being able to identify a fake check. I was a victim of fraud and am now thousands of dollars negative in my account which could have been avoided if they had never released the funds to me."

Once the first check deposited, they had me send {$1700.00} via XXXX bank payments to the vendors to purchase said materials. Once I informed the employer that the second check was on a hold and would be deposited in a week, they told me I shouldve told them and waited, but I should wait for it to deposit to send the money. 2 days later i saw that the first check had been returned as unpaid and the {$1900.00} had been deducted from my account. Once I reached out to the employer informing them the checks returned as unpaid and that I would be taking legal action if this wasnt reprimanded, they simply replied with Okay. and that was the last I ever heard from them. I tried to contact the bank and explain everything that happened, but was told since it was sent via XXXX, that there wasnt anything they could do to recover the funds.

The funds were deposited through my mobile banking app through XXXX bank on XX/XX/2023. I received a message on XX/XX/2023, stating that the funds were available. I was told by the "" employer '' that the funds should be available and asked for me to confirm. I did confirm they were deposited into my account, and from there he offered for the "" company '' to overnight a laptop instead, which required me to send the funds back. I did this through XXXX on my mobile banking app and cash app, between XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX. 
On the morning of XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX, I did check my mobile banking app and noticed the negative balance, which let me know I have been scammed. At XXXX XXXX central time, I called XXXX bank to let them know about the scam and to inform them I had filed a police report, a report with the XXXX XXXX XXXX, and I spoke with the hiring leader of the actual company, whom the scammers posed as. He also described my situation and said that this is a going thing and they are working with XXXX to resolve the issue. XXXX XXXX still chose to close out my bank account and required me to pay XXXX dollars within thirty days or set up a payment plan after being scammed and reporting the scam. 

I did file a complaint with the CFPB against XXXX bank on XX/XX/2023. I would also like to make note that the CFPB is not the only one I made a report to concerning this scam. I first spoke with the FDIC and they told me to get in contact with other bureaus and commissions as well. Seeing as though I was scammed, I should not have to owe any money to XXXX because these are insured funds. I also contacted the office of the comptroller of the currency and the federal trade commission and submitted the scam that I fell victim to. Although, these commissions and bureaus do not resolve reports on behalf of individuals. They use reports to investigate and bring cases against fraud and scams. Job scams are a big reoccurrence within days society because of the financial crisis we are all going through. I am not the only one that has fallen victim to this, our society is going through major layoffs within the tech company and other major companies as well. I work in the service industry as a personal trainer, however, a lot of clients are going through rough financial times. Which affects my business/ability to work. All I wanted to do was get a new job to help fund my education for XXXX XXXX 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I did receive a message from the CFPB in regards to a response from XXXX bank in regards to my original complaint. I was notified that they believed that I still owed them money. In that letter, they appointed me to Apelles Collections. I did call them and was told the debt had been in collections since XX/XX/XXXX. I was told by XXXX that a letter was sent on that date, however, I was not sent anything by mail. If I was sent anything I would have tried my best to dispute it like my previous attempts, I do strongly believe that as a victim of a scam, I should be helped and encouraged in this situation rather than held accountable for XXXX  ' actions. XXXX did tell me he will reach out to XXXX bank in regards to this matter because I did report it as a scam. I also showed proof through my various emails, messages, and police reports. I was scammed and did report to XXXX bank as soon as I knew. I also went through the correct channels to report the scam. I was also contacted by the company the scammers posed as and received confirmation that this is an ongoing scam and they are working with XXXX to stop this from happening again."

Per this individual, I shipped out the merchandise accordingly. My "" assignment '' afterward was to submit a review of the service I experienced at the merchant store. The individual and company I "" worked for '' were spoofs or frauds of legitimate ones. It was clear within a couple of weeks that things were very wrong, and as soon as I was confident of this, on XX/XX/XXXX, I began contacting my card companies and trying to rectify my situation. The scammer had arranged for a cashier 's check to be sent to me for my services, which turned out to be altered, according to my bank, which was the final catalyst for my suspicion of trouble. On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with local police, who advised me to block the scammer, which I did. I also was able to recover merchandise on XX/XX/XXXX, saving more loss ( there were XXXX, followed by gift cards, involved ). A very nice woman with Citibank High Risk  spoke with me on XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ), who understood my long-standing account and good history ; I made her aware of merchandise that didn't make it to a destination that would be coming back to me, which pleased her and said would help since it would bring me back under my credit limit ( because the scammer 's reimbursements were being returned ). She advised me to freeze my credit and have my phone and computer checked for malware, which I did do ; I never got to deal with her after that time. Both card companies have been investigating my case ; I have been diligent in providing information requested and needed. Today, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Citibank informed me they have finished their investigation, and decided I am responsible for all purchases, and all fines and interest while my balance has been holding in a conditional credit.

With Citibank, the subject of this issue, I'm looking at at least {$8600.00} total, with unknown fees and interest to be determined ; this amount is for charges I made ( while thinking I was doing legitimate work and expecting legitimate reimbursement ) in XXXX of XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX to be exact ). Additionally, I have had account with Citibank since XXXX, have exceptional credit, had all of my credit paid off with nothing due, and haven't had payment issues or late payments ; nothing bad and an excellent customer until this happened, and I wish this could have been taken into account when Citibank closed my account on XX/XX/XXXX, and referenced "" abuse of credit '' as a reason ( I have since been able to have an agent re-annotate this and reference my having been involved in a scam )."

Job Title : XXXX XXXX XXXX The job required opening multiple cryptocurrency accounts with Exchanges in the US to try the platforms in order to better assist customers with their operations. 
The exchanges would be linked to the XXXX chat app where customers would be connected. 
The first month was supposed to be a paid training : In order to use the platform the company through my manager, XXXX XXXX, would send me funds to do operations then report how the operations went. Then I had to sent the cash to their BTC account. 

I checked that the company actually exists, and no money was asked from me during the process, so I did not think it was a scam. The first operation on XX/XX/ was a bank transfer. I was asked to withdraw XXXX dollars cash to deposit in a bitcoin ATM. The transfer to their digital wallet was successful. The second wire transfer came the next day for XXXX Dollars. This time my manager requested that I used XXXX and XXXX XXXX. I had difficulty using the apps because my card kept being declined. XXXX, my manager then asked me to withdraw the amount cash from a branch, then do the same operation as the day before. 

At my Bank of America branch the teller told me that my account was flagged for a fraud alert. My account was frozen for my protection as stated by the bank as they were investigating the situation.

I contacted the manager immediately to figure out to get the issue resolved. She promised that she will contact the investors, and that there were no problems with the wires I received. 

For a week, the manager kept in touch through XXXX, asking about the situation. The bank refused to communicate with me. As soon as I sent the job contract and the documents justifying the transactions, Bank of America froze all my bank accounts and my husband 's account as well. Bank of America justified the closure due to crypto operations and that they switched to a no crypto currency. 

The XXXXs manager, stopped communicating as soon I informed her of the frozen accounts situation. By then, I was left with the conclusion that either XXXX XXXX XXXX, or the person who initiated the wires is a scam. 

Bank of America locked me out of my accounts, which put me in a difficult situation at the beginning of XXXX since I use my account to pay my bills. 

After a month of work, I did not receive any compensation for my work from XXXX XXXX, and I am yet to know about the outcome of the aforementioned wires. 

I have the job contract, the email communication with the recruiter and the XXXX company with their official email, as well the entire XXXX communication with the manager via XXXX.

When I called the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) they said that the driver did something wrong but would not provide any further information, although he knew exactly which package I was referring to. The mans name was XXXX XXXX XXXX  ), and there was also a woman named XXXX. 

Along with all of this, I have received an offer letter, welcome letter, company ID card, XXXX, XXXX, and direct deposit form from XXXX  ( employer ). One of these forms had their tax XXXX number listed, which I verified as correct. Even the website XXXX, if fake, was extremely well set up, as if someone used XXXX and asked for a website to meet numerous criteria. I also had a trainer who was going to call me to schedule some time on Monday XX/XX/XXXX to go over the company software and policies. THIS PERSON CALLED ME but I happened to be occupied at the time. We texted several times during the week. I did call a few times ( a XXXX XXXX number ) but he was busy and would get back to me. There is even a XXXX group which I believe is a part of this scam, as I wrote to one of the members that I was looking forward to meeting them but go no response of any type, even a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ''. 

As far as XXXX XXXX, we chatted nearly all day all week on XXXX. When I called him on XXXX, he answered, and we would talk for a bit, giving me updates on the process and where things moved forward and others were waiting on something. NOTE : XXXX is horrible at exporting chats, a feature they removed, but there was a workaround which I used to capture names, dates, and text. Single pics posted have links to use. 

Regarding USAA : I have contacted them at various times during the week of XX/XX/2023 to file a fraud investigation twice, fix my kids accounts, find out what they can do, and informed them several times that someone needs to contact me to get the emails and chat that I have. I am locked out of the mobile app and online banking so if there was a portal I was supposed to use or get notices in, I was not informed of it nor was I able to access it. 

I have been a member with USAA for 22 years with no real issues until this scam, and they are just throwing me to the curb. THEY NEVER ASKED ME FOR ANYTHING THAT I HAD TO HELP THE CASE. They have decided to discontinue doing business with me as a banking customer due to the nature and amount of this scam and are removing me from all accounts. Fine. But they are also affecting my kids banking accounts because I happened to be on them. My son is a XXXX, but on the USAA side they just saw my name and my name again on the accounts ( no suffix ), so they decided to just close out his debit card instead of verifying a SSN or member ID on the card. I did not have a debit card on his account. This was reported to them. 

All chats and emails will be attached to this complaint. If it happens that something else is needed, please call or email me and I will get you what you need if I have it."
8194212,"I was a victim of a job scam. I was offered a position of a remote data entry clerk, I went through a XXXX XXXX training and I was sent a check of {$2500.00}. I was told by the scammer that {$460.00} out of the XXXX were for my paid training. The rest would be to fund my equipment. I was told by the scammer to deposit the check and send over {$400.00} that were available that day from the deposited check through a wire transfer. I made the wire transfer through my bank institution Wells Fargo. I have the wire transfer details to the scammer I sent the money to. The check went through that XXXX  when I deposited it. {$400.00} were available from that check. I sent over the {$400.00} through the wire transfer and the XXXX XXXX I got a notification from the bank that the funds were being held due to unusual activity. Since I sent the funds a XXXX XXXX, the transfer was complete and the funds had been withdrawn from my own personal funds that I had saved in my XXXX  account. Thats when I realized that it was XXXX  a scam because I tried reaching out to the scammer and he became unresponsive after that. I wouldve never proceeded with the transfer if the check wouldve been revoked as soon as I made the deposit, but the check went through and the bank made {$400.00} available that XXXX. It is not right that the bank used my personal hard earned money to complete the transfer. I needed that money to pay my rent and now XXXX behind on bills due to this error."
8423861,"I was involved in my daughter 's job scam incident. She found out the she was being frauded and we filed a police report, she also filed reports with the FTC, SEC, FBI IC3 and AG FL. We then were directed to file disputes with the bank accounts involved. I tried filing with Wells Fargo on XX/XX/24. I was met with hostility and resistance. The agent said there was no way to file these transactions for a dispute. I hung up to call back and speak with someone else who told me the 2 disputes were filed previously. I received a letter in the mail dated XX/XX/24 stating that only 1 of the disputes were filed and it was denied. Wells Fargo knew I wanted to send in documents showing this and was told I would be contacted by the bank to send it in. There was no communication from Wells Fargo in this investigation. I called back on XX/XX/24 to appeal and was told I can not file an appeal. The supervisor, XXXX was extremely rude. She began reading definitions of fraud and scams and was being very demeaning. The second dispute was never filed, I was told that disputes with XXXX can not be filed with Wells Fargo, they are a separate company. I had to call back a second time and speak to someone else who finally filed the dispute for the XXXX transaction."
8714085,"I was the victim of a work scam. I answered an e-mail sent out through the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX e-mail, regarding working from home for a professor related to the XXXX program. I answered and accepted the position. On XX/XX/2024, after supposedly being employed and completing an assignment I was given, I received a check for {$1600.00} from my "" employer ''. I used mobile deposit to deposit the check into my XXXX savings account and received a confirmation of the transaction from the bank and the funds seemed to be available on XXXX. On the following day, XX/XX/2024 my "" employer '' requested that I transfer {$1000.00} of the funds to another employee so that the other employee could use the funds to make a purchase for the department. I attempted to transfer the funds to this other person first on XXXX and then on XXXX and both times the transactions were declined. My employer asked me to then try Zelle. ( I had been following their instructions on what to do ). The transfer of {$1000.00} from my account to the other employee seemed to go through using Zelle. The situation seemed odd to me so I reached out to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  department on XX/XX/2024 ( ticket # XXXX ). Later, that same day the IT department called me and told me that the XXXX e-mail used to communicate with the so called employer/professor was fraudulent. I immediately contacted the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX police department and subsequently the XXXX XXXX XXXX Police department ( report # XXXX ). On the same day, XXXX I also contacted my bank, XXXX, to inform them of the situation. The bank immediately "" froze '' my accounts both checking and savings. On XX/XX/2024, the XXXXXXXX XXXX department recommended that I file a report on IC3.gov, internal crime complaint center, which I did. On XX/XX/2024, I was contacted by XXXX and was told that I owed the bank the {$1000.00} that was sent out through Zelle. XXXX said it was my responsibility as the originally deposited check eventually bounced and the funds were not there. I feel like I am being punished twice as a victim and the bank is seemingly free of responsibility for the situation. The "" virtual funds '' were transferred multiple times before XXXX determined the check was fraudulent. If XXXX had verified the check sooner or even put a hold on the funds related to the unusual activity the {$1000.00} would not have been released. Zelle could have declined the transaction themselves just as XXXX and XXXX did. If Zelle had done this, the money would never have gone anywhere. I would never have requested the transaction if I knew I didn't have the funds to cover the transaction. I truly feel like the bank, XXXX, and Zelle should share some of the responsibility for the victimization of the consumer by fraud. All of us were taken advantage of. Now a XXXX XXXX who is already short on funds and who was willing to take a job to earn some extra money, is expected to pay back what I don't even have."

10042620,"Subject : Urgent Request for Assistance in Recovering Funds from Fraudulent Job Scam and Denied Claim by Wells Fargo Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Team, I am writing to urgently seek your assistance regarding a fraudulent job scam that has caused me significant financial distress. I am a student, and the amount involved is a substantial portion of my finances during this critical period. I have exhausted efforts with my bank, Wells Fargo, to recover the funds, but unfortunately, my claim was denied after 60 days, leaving me with no resolution. 

Incident Details : On XX/XX/XXXX, I identified that a check I had deposited as part of a supposed job offer for a Salesforce Administrator role was counterfeit. The scam was well-orchestrated, beginning with an email from what appeared to be a legitimate company offering a job opportunity. I received a detailed job briefing and was instructed to install the Teams app for an interview. The interactions, including the email addresses and the individuals involved, appeared genuine and professional. 

After a successful virtual interview, I was informed that I had secured the position and was provided with a check for {$4500.00}, supposedly to purchase office supplies and a XXXX. I was instructed to deposit the check and wire a significant portion of the funds to a specified vendor for these purchases. This process repeated with additional requests for wire transfers for software and other expenses after I was provided with the checks for {$2600.00} and {$1800.00}. 

Checks were deposited to my account and below are the details : Between ( XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX ) Transaction Type : Check Deposit Amount of Transaction : {$4500.00} ; {$2600.00} ; {$1800.00} Recipients Bank : XXXX XXXX XXXX ( mobile check deposit ). 

I was asked to wire transfer the funds to the below account after the deposited check 's funds got available in my Bank. Below are the details : Between ( XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX ) Transaction Type : WIRE Amount of Transaction : {$1800.00} ; {$2600.00} ; {$2900.00} Recipients Bank : WELLS FARGO BANK , N.A . 

Each time, the funds appeared briefly available in my account before the checks were ultimately identified as counterfeit, resulting in a total loss of {$7400.00}. I immediately contacted my bank 's XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) check fraud division on XX/XX/XXXX, on the same day of identifying the check as counterfeit, and initiated a claim to recall the wire transfers. 

However, after a long wait of over 60 days, I received a notice from Wells Fargo ( recipient account where the funds were wire transferred to ) stating that my claim had been denied. This outcome is devastating, given the significant financial impact this has had on me. Despite acting quickly and reporting the fraudulent activity promptly, I feel I am not receiving the justice or support necessary from the bank in recovering my funds. 

Request for Assistance : I am respectfully requesting the CFPB 's intervention in this matter. I have all the documentation related to the scam, including the job offer emails, the counterfeit checks, wire transfer receipts, Consumer Report To The Federal Trade Commission and the claim denial notice from Wells Fargo. I will submit all these attachments for your review. 

I kindly urge you to review my case and take appropriate action to assist me in recovering my funds from Wells Fargo. The amount lost is a huge sum for me, and I am seeking justice and financial relief in this matter. 

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to your response and any steps you can take to resolve this issue. 

Sincerely, XXXX Date : XX/XX/XXXX"

Chase said there was nothing they could do to stop the checks nor return my wire transfers. The fake checks had not been endorsed and they were deposited immediately. I spoke to the bank clerk about why some checks are deposited immediately and others are held, and she said Chase doesn't have a system for how they handle good/bad checks.

Tactics vary, but below are common characteristics of cryptocurrency investment fraud scammer personas : Excessive flattery Empathizing with, and often suffering from, similar life events as the victim ( e.g., if a victim is going through a divorce, then the scammer may be going through a divorce, too ).

Suffering from a hardship that requires help from the victim.

Sharing pictures, often selfies, of themselves. 
Offering to meet in person but making those meetings contingent upon the victim accomplishing a task ( e.g., we can meet once you raise enough money ). 
Offering to meet in person, but always finding an excuse at the last minute for why they cant. 
Expressing a strong romantic interest in the victim. 
Agreeing to some video conference calls but preferring instead to speak over text. 
3. The Pitch Once trust is established with victims, criminals introduce the topic of investing. It's common for scammers to say they themselvesor people in their family or close networkare experts in such investments. They may promise they can bring the victim in on "" the ground floor. '' Types of investments can vary, however common ones include binary trading, liquidity mining, and gold futures. 

4. The Initial Investment Once the scammer convinces the victim to participate in their scheme, the scammer will instruct the victim how to invest the money, as follows : Open a cryptocurrency account at a reputable exchange. 
Transfer money from a traditional bank account to the new cryptocurrency account. 
Convert the moneynow hosted on the cryptocurrency exchangeto the cryptocurrency type the scammer specifies, e.g., Bitcoin, Ether, Tether. 
Open an account on the "" investment platform '' provided by the scammer or an individual or group that the scammer directed the victim to. 
Deposit the cryptocurrency to the investment platform either directly or through a private wallet. 
Investment Platforms : Note that these "" platforms '' exist in the form of what appear to be traditional websites, either accessible via the web or through a specific browser only accessible via cryptocurrency applications. Common factors include : Registration using an email address or phone number.

Two-factor authentication ( e.g., a phone number + an email address ) to log in. 
A website name that closely mimicsor "" spoofs '' a legitimate site. 
A professional-looking site design that shows the portfolio in an appealing manner. 
A customer support portal used to communicate about investments and withdrawals. 
Did You Know? 

Scammers may use deepfake technology and/or hire real people to engage with you on the phone. Even if they're real people you're speaking to, they could be part of a scam. 



Cryptocurrency Job Scams Cryptocurrency Job Scams Cryptocurrency job scams begin when scammers, masquerading as employees of legitimate companies, recruit victims and require them to deposit their own money in order to complete the job. 

Red Flag : Were you introduced to the investment scheme by someone in person? If it was someone you know, it could be that they, too, are unwitting victims, and you should warn them immediately. If it was a stranger, and they pitched the idea not long after meeting you, it is entirely possible they are part of a criminal network supporting these schemes. 

5. The Growing Investment Once the victim starts to "" invest, '' returns shown on the investment platform will appear to be extremely lucrative, encouraging the victim to invest more and more. It is common in the early stages for the scammers to allow victims to withdraw not only the original deposit but the earnings as well. This is meant to trick victimsa means to reassure them that the platform is legitimate. Scammers use various means to sweeten the pot, or encourage further investing. Examples include : "" Matching '' Providing their own funds to the victims portfolio to help the victim reach an ( arbitrary ) investment goal. 
"" Scarcity '' Stating that returns or investment opportunities are only available in a short time period. 


6. Taxes, Fees, and the End of the Scheme Once the victim is ready to withdrawal all their earnings, they will find their account frozen and an arbitrary requirement will arise, usually in the form of paying "" taxes '' or "" fees '' to unlock their funds. 

This is a trap : it is simply another method used by the scammers to try and convince victims to invest even more money. 

It can be a particularly devastating point in the scheme, as victims will often pay more money to unlock their funds than any amount they previously deposited. At this point, there is usually nothing the victim can do : the scammers will never unlock the funds and it's likely they have already withdrawn those funds into criminally controlled cryptocurrency wallets inaccessible to the victim. In the end, the victim loses all the money they deposited into the scheme.

11866982,"Hello Team, I am writing to formally dispute the locking of my Bank of America account XXXX XXXX XXXX, which I was informed of following the deposit of a check, which I got from a person act as HR of a company, that later returned as unpaid. I want to clarify that I was a victim of a fraudulent job scam and acted in good faith, following standard procedures and instructions provided by the bank. 

Background of the Incident 1. I applied for a job with a company claiming to be XXXX, and after an interview and task, I was offered a position. 
2. As part of the onboarding process, they requested my banking details and later issued me a check for {$9900.00}, which I was instructed to deposit. 
3. Before depositing, I approached a BoFA relationship manager for verification, but I was directed to use the XXXX deposit feature instead of receiving a manual review. 
4. After depositing the check via mobile scan, Bank of America returned the check as unpaid, at which point I immediately attempted to contact the employer, but they became unresponsive. 
5. Instead of discussing this issue with me, Bank of America abruptly closed my account ( I got to know when i went to bank to discuss and inform them that i have been scammed ), instead of understanding my situation they refused to provide a reasoned explanation or resolution when i also called their customer support and never bothered to listen my case even though I have all the proofs of emails and screenshots. 

Reasons This Closure is Unjustice I am a fraud victim, not a perpetrator. I had no knowledge that the check was fraudulent. I acted in good faith and reached out to BoFA for help before making the deposit. 
Bank of America failed to conduct due diligence. When I sought assistance, the relationship manager did not review the check, instead instructing me to deposit it myself. 
Immediate account closure without review is excessive. I was given no opportunity to clarify my situation, nor was I provided with a formal dispute process. 
This decision affects my ability to bank elsewhere. If my account has been reported to XXXX or XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  I request immediate correction, as I was not involved in this fraudulent activity. 

Please help me to maintain my bank account. your assistance is highly appreciated. 
Looking forward for a resolution. 
Regards, XXXX XXXX."

I filed a claim with my bank, Capital One, who ultimately denied. The bank encouraged me to send documented proof prior to this decision, which I did. I requested information on how they made their decision to deny me, and it turns out they never used the information I had sent them and simply made this decision off our brief phone call when I first filed the claim.

XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX XXXX requests my name, address, bank, and phone number for check distribution. Several days follow and I have to follow up for the check to be sent. 

XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX XXXX and I continue to communicate back and forth as I begin the illustration project and provide first drafts. XXXX provides feedback on multiple occasions through text and email. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Check is delivered ( attached document for reference ). XXXX XXXX texts me immediately upon its delivery to inform me that the check has arrived and that I should cash it digitally as soon as possible. I do so. He states that the {$5000.00} dollar check has been deposited successfully and deducted from their account the moment I cashed it. My account was pending at this time.

XXXX provides a document supposedly from the school stating the projects Phase XXXX cancellation ( attached document for reference ). 

XXXX texts me saying that I should send a XXXX payment to the email of XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). He also requests screenshot receipts of this transaction. I send the {$2500.00} and provide documentation. 

XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX XXXX texts and calls me first thing in the morning stating that the project is canceled in its entirety, and that I should immediately XXXX an additional {$1500.00} to XXXX XXXX at XXXX. I received a second document that morning from XXXX confirming the entire projects cancellation, apparently signed off by XXXX XXXX of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

A check reversal of the {$5000.00} check had taken place automatically earlier that morning, and {$5000.00} was removed from my bank account sending me into the negative. Most likely due to being a fraudulent check. At this point, I have also already paid them back {$2500.00} of my own actual mone. 

I call my bank, Capital One immediately and begin to file a claim for a scam/fraud. They inform me that they received the {$2500.00} and it had been successfully deposited into their account, which also happened to be a Capital One account. 

XXXX continues to text for immediate updates and keeps stating that the {$2500.00} I sent prior did not process. At this point, I inform him that there is no money left in my account, and that their check to was reversed and I am owed {$2500.00}. 

XXXX slowly starts to stop communicating with light contact, but never fully responds to my concerns. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I follow up XXXX more time in the morning requesting the return of my {$2500.00} ( claim amount ) along with {$1000.00} owed to me for compensation. No response. XXXX XXXX officially goes dark and I never hear from him again. 

Capital One stated that I could provide any proof and documentation to help support my claim after my first initial call on XX/XX/XXXX. I provide Capital One with all text messages, emails, documents and fraudulent check via email. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Capital Ones responds stating that my claim is denied. I request documentation regarding how they made this decision, as stated as an option in their email. 2-5 days required for processing. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Capital One provides documentation regarding their decision to deny my claim. The email showed that they did not review the proof that I sent them and made their decision solely on my first phone call reporting the scam which does not go into enough detail based on their questioning. 

XX/XX/XXXX : After discovering that Capital One did not utilize the information that I provided them for their own internal investigation, I proceeded to call XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX personally to look into the matter. XXXX suggested that I email their HR team explaining the situation. As of XX/XX/XXXX, I have yet to hear back any information."

I completed their XXXX  assessment as requested. After a day or two, I received a job offer. The HR representative informed me that someone would contact me by phone regarding next steps. This individual later called me and discussed my preferences for work equipment. 

The caller then explained that they would be emailing me a check for {$8900.00} which I needed to deposit into my bank account and then wire transfer the funds. When I questioned why such a large amount needed to be processed this way, I was told it was "" company policy. '' After depositing the check and completing the wire transfer as instructed, I discovered within minutes that my bank account was overdrawn by approximately {$5600.00}. I immediately contacted Bank of America by phone and was advised to open a fraud case on that very same day. My tax money and my pay was on auto transfer and now its - {$3000.00} After its been 40 days I called Bank of America and spoke to a supervisor for an update. He was very rude and told me that its none of your concern and we are waiting for the other bank to respond and we wont send any further attempts to the XXXX. It has not been 60 days and I received an email the very next day after speaking to a supervisor that the case has been closed. So basically my {$8900.00} is gone and now I have to pay {$3000.00} to the Bank of America. 


I am calling Bank of America again so complaint about this situation. I dont know what fraud department of Bank of America do. This is so wrong how to treat you customers. For me {$8900.00} is not a small amount and it was the first time that happened to me"

13887496,"I am submitting this complaint as a victim of a job scam that resulted in financial loss and insufficient support from my financial institution, Chase Bank. 

I was contacted by an individual who falsely claimed to represent a legitimate company and offered me a remote job position. Believing the offer to be real, I was sent a check to cover equipment costs and was instructed to wire funds as part of the onboarding process. The first wire transaction failed to process, but the second one went through successfully. However, shortly afterward, Chase Bank identified the deposited check as fraudulent by which time, the receiving party had already received the funds I had wired. I was operating under the false pretense that I was employed by a legitimate company. 

Upon realizing the situation, I immediately contacted Chase Bank and filed a claim. A Chase representative informed me that although the claim would likely be denied, it could be reopened upon submission of supporting evidence. 

As expected, I received a formal denial of the claim. However, I was not given the opportunity to reopen it or to provide additional evidence. I was denied any further support from Chase, and the matter was closed without a thorough investigation, despite my proactive efforts and cooperation. 

Following the guidance of a Chase associate, I filed a criminal complaint with the FBIs Internet Crime Complaint Center ( IC3.gov ), but I have yet to receive meaningful resolution or recourse. 

I am seeking the CFPBs assistance in urging Chase Bank to properly review my case, allow for a resubmission of evidence, and take appropriate responsibility in supporting victims of increasingly job scams in this era of financial instability. 

I want to reflect and point out the filed attach of the message I have received from XXXX XXXX  XXXX labeled as [ Chase_Response ]. 

I must call into question the credibility of the so-called "" beneficiary 's '' response, which Chase has quoted in its denial : "" PLS BE ADVISED XXXX HAS DENIED DEBIT AUTHORIZATION SO WE ARE NOT ABLE TO COMPLY WITH YR REQUEST. PLEASE HAVE REMITTER CONTACT BENEFICIARY DIRECTLY. WE CLOSE OUR FILE. '' Is this truly the kind of language and format one would expect from a legitimate corporate entity or financial institution? The lack of professionalism, clarity, and formality in this message should raise immediate red flags to XXXX. It is difficult to believe that any reputable organization would issue a response so poorly worded and dismissive. That Chase would accept this as a valid basis to close a casewithout further verification or investigationis deeply concerning and suggests a failure to uphold proper standards of due diligence. 

I have also attached the email thread by the perpetrators of this scam so that a fuller picture can be made.

I attempted to call Wells Fargo and explained my issue with the banker, to which she said to contact my employer, I asked if I could put her on hold while I messaged my supposed employer, but she hung up on me. On the XXXX, I made another call to Wells Fargo customer service and explained my problem to the banker, to which she told me the same thing of Insufficient funds, I then explained that Id spoken to my supposed employer and had been told that things were fine on their end. The banker then advised me to re-deposit the check and see if it went through. After speaking to my supposed employer, I was emailed another check and went through the usual process, and the check was accepted, and recorded to come into my account that Saturday, on the XXXX. On the XXXX, I saw that Id received another email in the middle of the night stating my deposit couldnt be added to my account, and unlike the email Id received on the XXXX, there was no recorded reason, and up until this point Id thought my supposed employer was having issues with their financial department. I called the customer service line, and was told they werent able to tell me the issue with the deposit, and that I needed to call the department number enclosed in the email id been sent on the XXXX, however because it was Saturday, and the department didnt open until Monday, I called them this morning, and it was not until this morning when I was told that the issues had to with fraudulence. I wasnt aware of the issue with printing the checks, and in all of the customer service correspondence Id had over the phone and via emails, fraudulent checks was not mentioned. Later today I was sent an email telling me my account would be closed in the XXXX because of the issues with the checks. I called customer service looking for a solution, to which one of the managers very condescendingly informed me I was likely a victim of a job scam, in which the scammers posed as a company that had hired me. She then proceeded to give me a flat Im sorry about the miscommunication from customer service, before telling me that my account could not be recovered, as according to her Its a risk for the bank, and we do not have a prior or future relationship with your account. There was no miscommunication, I was not even informed of fraudulence or received any alerts until this morning when I had to call after multiple instances of unsatisfactory customer support. The woman I spoke to even acknowledged it was unreasonable that I wasnt properly informed in the emails I received, and nowhere in the Mobile Deposit section of their app was there any kind of fraud alert or mention of potential danger with printed checks. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and this is my first official bank account, I called multiple times with my issue and was even advised by the customer service to re-deposit the check, so at what point would I have realized these were fraudulent? Especially when the scam in question had presented itself as trustworthy, with nothing negative coming up during extensive investigation through an online search? The manger I spoke to even said that some scammers will pose as reputable businesses."

14719848,"b'Subject: Urgent Request for Assistance in Fraud Recovery  Mishandled Case by Bank of America\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\nI am urgently seeking your assistance in recovering funds lost due to Bank of Americas mishandling of a fraud case involving my checking account. Despite being FDIC-insured, the bank has failed to properly investigate my fraud claim and provided inconsistent and misleading responses.\n\nSummary of the Issue:\nI fell victim to a sophisticated job scam on XXXX  involving a fake hiring process for a Regulatory Affairs Specialist role at HeartFlow Inc. The scammer, posing as recruiter XXXX XXXX XXXX initiated contact and conducted a fake hiring process, eventually offering me the job. I was then contacted by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who directed me to deposit two Chase bank checks to fund my remote work setup.\n* XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXnFollowing the check clearance, I was instructed to pay third-party vendors via XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\nA few days later, Bank of America reversed both deposits citing fraud and began withdrawing the same amounts from my account as return item chargebacks. However, the funds had already been used to pay the scammersfunds I never would have accessed had the bank not approved the checks.\nWhen I reported the fraud, I was given two claim numbers:\XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXnLater, the bank denied the existence of these claims, then changed their story to say they were filed with $0 claim amounts, which is illogical and contradictory. This mishandling raises serious concerns about internal processes and accountability at Bank of America.\n\nKXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Bank reversed both checks totaling XXXXI spoke with several bank associates including Madison, Bea (ref. XXXX XXXX, and XXXX, but none provided a satisfactory resolution.\n\nMy Concern:\nWhy did the bank approve and make the check funds available if they were later deemed fraudulent? Standard banking procedures should prevent this. Had the checks not been approved, I wouldnt have used the funds. The banks failure to properly verify the checks or support my fraud claim has resulted in a severe financial loss and emotional distress.\nI respectfully urge your help in recovering these funds and holding the bank accountable for its negligence.\nSincerely,XXXX XXXX"
14841507,"I am submitting this formal complaint against XXXX XXXX ( operating as Cash App ) due to its failure to take appropriate action or provide a satisfactory response regarding a series of fraudulent cryptocurrency transactions processed through its platform. Despite submitting a detailed complaint to Cash Apps legal and compliance team on XX/XX/XXXX, I have yet to receive a meaningful response or resolution. 
Nature of the Complaint Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I fell victim to a complex online job scam, which led me to make multiple payments in XXXX using Cash App. These transactions were initiated under false pretenses and ultimately resulted in significant financial loss. 
Through independent blockchain tracing, I have confirmed that several of the fraudulent transactions I made were funneled into Cash Applinked wallet addresses, including : XXXX XXXX XXXX These wallets received proceeds from the fraudulent scheme, and I provided Cash App with full transaction records and blockchain evidence, including transaction IDs and wallet mapping that clearly demonstrate the path of funds to their platform. 
Despite this, Cash App has failed to : Launch or communicate any internal investigation ; Freeze or report the implicated wallets ; Provide restitution or assistance ; Comply with its obligations under applicable financial and consumer protection laws. 
Regulatory Violations and Concerns As a regulated Money Services Business ( MSB ), XXXX XXXX is subject to : The Bank Secrecy Act ( 31 U.S.C. 5311 ) requiring robust AML policies and Suspicious Activity Report ( SAR ) filing ; XXXX Guidance XXXX recognizing Cash App as a Money Transmitter XXXX to federal obligations ; Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1693 ) protecting consumers from unauthorized digital fund transfers ; FTC Act ( 15 U.S.C. 45 ) prohibiting unfair and deceptive practices, including neglecting to act against fraud ; Anti-Money Laundering statutes ( 18 U.S.C. 1956 & 1957 ) prohibiting facilitation of criminally derived funds. 
The evidence I submitted to Cash App clearly indicated a pattern of criminal activity facilitated via their platform. Their non-response and inaction reflect a serious failure of oversight, compliance, and consumer duty."
14854703,"Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/year>, I was the victim of a sophisticated fake job scam that involved XXXX transfers through my Citibank account totaling {$3500.00}. The scammers posed as a legitimate employer, conducted what appeared to be a real hiring process, sent me fake checks, and instructed me to use XXXX to purchase remote office equipment from vendors they claimed were part of the onboarding process. 

I later learned the checks were fraudulent, and the job was fake. The scammers deceived me into using XXXX to send my personal funds. I filed a fraud dispute with Citibank, but it was denied on the basis that the transactions were authorized. While I technically sent the money, I was doing so under false pretenses and manipulation. 

I am now appealing Citibanks decision. This scam is a documented type of fraud acknowledged by the FTC, FBI, and XXXX itself. I have reported the incident to the FTC, IC3, and local police. I acted in good faith and believe I should not be financially responsible for being deceived in this way. 

I respectfully request that Citibank re-evaluate this matter and issue a refund or provide alternative compensation."
15539713,"I got a job offering from my school ( XXXX ) email regarding a virtual assistant position. I filled out the job form on the school website and I later received an email from XXXX collective saying I got the job. Afterwards, a person claiming to have the name XXXX XXXX gave me a fake check for {$4900.00}. He told me to deposit the check into my Wells Fargo checking account, which I did, not knowing it was a fake check at the time. After I deposited the check, only {$400.00} was available that day. He told me to donate the {$400.00} to an orphanage through XXXX XXXX. Thus, I transferred the {$400.00} from my Wells Fargo checking account into my XXXX XXXX and sent the {$400.00} to the person he wanted me to send the money to. This was on XX/XX/year>. The next day ( XX/XX/year> ), he wanted me to wire at first send {$2000.00} through XXXX XXXX to another person, which I didnt because I felt something was off. However I transferred the {$2000.00} into my XXXX XXXX, but I didnt spend it. I realized that I was given a fake check and that XXXX XXXX was a scammer. I then transferred the money back into my account, but XXXX took a {$15.00} transaction fee, so {$1900.00} was transferred back into my Wells Fargo checking account. I notified Wells Fargo the same day. They replaced my cards and I filled a claim against all the transactions that occurred after I deposited the fake check. Wells Fargo took over a week to review my claim and denied it on XX/XX/year>. As expected the check bounced and Wells Fargo took back the {$4900.00}. However, they took back an additional {$1900.00}. They said that their wasnt an error with the translations except for the {$1900.00} I transferred back into my account. I never spent that money. I fell for a job scam, realized it and tried to do what was right ; but Wells Fargo didnt help me at all in this situation. Instead, they took {$1900.00} from me. Now my account is in the negatives since XX/XX/year>. I owe the bank {$1600.00} as of now."
15604144,"On XX/XX/year>, I was the victim of a job scam. I deposited a fraud check that I understood to be a valid check. Then I was told to purchase home office equipment with this money by sending money to a certain employee via XX/XX/XXXX. It all seemed extremely legal at this time. I then started to suspect the contacts were not genuine. This job was offered as a work from home job. Later in the day, I called the company I applied for and they began to tell me they were aware of people using their company name for fraudulent activities. I then tried to contact the HR manager and were unable to contact them. I then blocked them from being above to contact me and called Synovus to report the fraud activity. At this point, I was told that they would have to have some time to verify the fraudulent activity. I had to close my checking account that I had for over 40 years. I retired from XXXX of 31 years so I had an employee checking account. At this point my checking account had been debited for the fraud amounts which caused my account to become overdrawn. I visited a branch prior to knowing my account was now in a negative status. I was going to open a new Checking account and move my funds To the new account. The young woman helping me was not very friendly and after looking at what happened, began treating me like I was beneath her. She informed me I had to bring the old account to a positive balance before I could open a New checking account So I made a deposit in the amount over the balance If the fraud transactions. I then went to another location to open a new checking account I didnt want to go back to the same person who waited in me earlier. This lady at the other branch proceeded to open a new checking account, a new savings account, a debit card and a XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. She also ordered new checks. 
This is where everything started going downhill. I was told I couldnt access my money from my new checking account. The banker checked into why and called me back later in the day and let me know they were investigating all of the issues due to fraud. They never actually closed the old account only froze itll monies from being withdrawn and I wasnt allowed to make purchases or write any checks. I never understood why the old account wasnt closed like I requested. No one explained why. It seemed as though the right hand didnt know what the left was doing. Each time I called Synovus, I got different answers to what was going on and what I needed to do going forward. In the meantime, I had no access to any funds AND my social security monies had posted to the old account which is my ONLY means of income. I was told I couldnt have my money and had to wait for any transactions to post. I had to borrow money in order to pay my rent and electric bill. I was being treated like the criminal and not a victim as this time. They then proceeded to inform me they did not want my business any longer and they were going to close everything I had with them. I was beyond devastated and so worried because I had no means of getting my money nor paying my bills. I am XXXX XXXX XXXX and do NOT need this kind of stress. After 2weeks, I was able to get the {$150.00} from my new savings account then eventually was told I could have my social security money but when I went in the branch to pick up the check for this, the computer system was down and could not get my money again. ALSO, my dad loaned me money in the amount of {$1000.00} to help until all of this was straight. THEN was told the check my dad wrote to me was FRAUDULENT! I could Not believe this. I felt like I was in a third world country at this time. Apparently my dads credit union informed Synovus that the phone number on the check wasnt a valid one and the signature didnt look valid! The phone number on the check wasnt an old lan line they had that they had disconnected but they never updated their checks with their cell phone numbers. My dads wife signed the check but shes listed on the account so it was all good even though I was repeatedly being told it was a fraudulent check! I was told they needed to go back and get it all straight and I wont be able to access that money for another month! 
All I want to do at this point it get MY money and walk away for good. The feeling is totally mutual believe me. I have never in my life been treated like this. EVER. I was living a nightmare. I still havent gotten my money. I hope to go to the branch today to get a check for my social security. Please look into how all this was handled and I do hope someone can learn from my experience and have a much better experience."
